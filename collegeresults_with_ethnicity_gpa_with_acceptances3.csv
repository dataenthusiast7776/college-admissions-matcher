1kmzbh4,YT BOY JUST CLUTCHED UP HIS STATE SCHOOL 💯,"**Demographics:** Senior, Male, White, Massachusetts, genuinely kind of broke, no demographic hooks 5'11"" United States citizen

**Intended Major(s):** Computer Science literally everywhere besides pure math major change at UMass Amherst (I think you can see where this is going)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1480 (710RW, 770M)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 91.8/100 UW GPA according to [some calcs](https://www.iastate.edu/gpa-calculator) this is 3.7 uw? no ranking (equity). Like 5 B’s and C+ freshman history

**Coursework:** 10 AP’s 9 Honors, Multivariable Calculus. Doing diff eq right now for fun bc I can't afford it at CC. Not really the most rigorous path because I’m not going to take AP Bio, AP Chem, or AP E&M. Placed in full year remedial algebra 1 as a freshman because I totally failed online 8th grade, lowk talked about this in additional information. 

Only took 2 AP exams so far but got a 5 in AP World History, i'm doing the other 8 rn (a few that I took the class for in the past but didn't take the exam for☠) just absolutely smashed the ap lang and mechanics exams, now I only have 1 left 

**Awards:** **(these are buns but I don't think awards are really a deal-breaker)**

Scholarship to take classes at a certain college

Like 800$ Scholarship for some program

AP Scholar

Graduating with a distinction in physics

NHS 

**Extracurriculars: (without descriptions)**

* CS/Stats research @ t1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 university (🤔) (only UPenn, yale, MIT, Brown, Harvard, WPI, UMass know about this EC because it started after deadlines so I put it in update letter)
* SWE Intern @ a nonprofit
* Like 500 hours volunteering as assistant coach in local youth sports
* IT Intern @ a city hall
* Many open source projects related to CS/Meteorology with a few users 
* Varsity Ice Hockey 🥶🏒
* TA an AP class / office hours ETC
* ~~Some competitive cartography/mapping stuff 😂~~
* Finance intern @ teeny tiny nonprofit 🤏
* NICHE Foreign language to talk to my friends
* Family responsibilities (really don't know why I put this at 10 because it was probably my biggest EC technically)

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

I wrote my personal statement about dumb physics theories I made in elementary school and how seemingly profound ideas could be rendered meaningless without context and purpose, and how that experience inspires me to ground my pursuits in relevance and impact. Definitely a fun essay but no one thought it was good. (actually I read it to an LLM after the fact and it said it was good)

Physics / TA teacher: Great, came a long way in her class and am now TA-ing with her

CS Teacher: Known all 4 years, great rapport, understands my technical skills well

Counselor: Great relationship, always commends me for being one of his most motivated students.

**Supplementals:** Kind of all over the place, talked a lot about interdisciplinary work / passion for applying CS to meteorology and linguistics, all of them were solid. I think I did a good job at coming across as an interesting person especially at schools that ask weird questions.

**Reflections (2nd time)**

None, obviously I *could* cry about applying as a CS major to the majority of my schools without too much enthusiasm or CS EC's, (evidently, I was able to just throw this slight interest away entirely when it came to crunch time) but whatever. Also, no matter where someone goes to college they're going to be grinding the second they get there, and there won't even be time to loathe about this hypothetical alternate scenario where they get accepted into their dream school, right? This literally is the perfect mindset that prevented me from getting disappointed in the slightest that I didn't end up with any acceptances to my big reach schools. So it really doesn't matter, i'm so hyped to grind in college gng and you should be too, if you're reading this, comment ""hyped"" to show that you're hyped to grind in college too 💯(holy tangent)",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kmzbh4/yt_boy_just_clutched_up_his_state_school/,1747282603,1480,,3.7,White,"UMass Lowell* (Accepted for ""spring 2026"" 💀💀💀💀like 90% ride)","Accepted**, UMass Lowell* (Accepted for ""spring 2026"" 💀💀💀💀like 90% ride), UMASS AMHERST*** **(OMGGGG ORIGINALLY WAITLISTED, COMMITTED 100%)**, Massasoit / Bunker hill Community College ☠☠☠*","Northeastern*, NYU*",Male

Penn: interviewer was nice, she didnt ask me any questions. i just asked her questions for basically 30mins

Rice: super nice, i think i demonstrated my fit with the school really well.

**Additional Information:**

my main advice is to keep your expectations low during this process. UTK was always my top choice even before applying to colleges and i knew it was feasible for me as an autoadmit + guarenteed merit scholarships. fall in love with your safeties PLSSSS. i was truly blessed to get off the vandy waitlist.

i dont know i got waitlisted so much, i had really bad luck with the privates. i really specifically tailored my college list based on the NPC and seeing what my family could afford, leading me to all these privates as they give great need based aid vs a oos public. the publics i picked were specifically for full scholarship oppurtunities i didnt win :(

UPCHIEVE IS A GODSEND!! I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH ALL MY APPLICATIONS WITHOUT THE HELP OF THIS CBO!! If you attend a title 1 school pls check it out its awesome

i did not like USC enough to wait a semester to go & BU was a bit expensive + didnt love the campus. i think i got accepted to BU vs getting waitlisted there bc i toured the campus in person during a boston trip.

2. Retired Chem teacher (10/10): Knows me since middle school and saw me mature like a 2nd mom.
3. IGCSE Section head (8/10): Also knows me since middle school but barely ever writes LORs.
4. Math teacher (6/10): Knows me since freshman year but just doesn't know how to write (Not making fun of him, but he chatgpt-ed my report card every single time. All of us in his class got the same comment with our name replaced)

For context: My school doesn't allow CS teachers to give LORs for some reason?

**Essays:**

My personal statement was about how, due to my long name, I've been given various nicknames by different people and how those nicknames represent a different version of me to each of them.  
English teacher and counsellor found the idea fascinating.  
Wrote too many supplemental to comment on them

**Interviews:**

1. Princeton - Eh, i'd say it went better than I expected but not the best it could've been. Mainly to say I didn't know how to prepare for it so I kinda just went with it
2. Stanford - Absolutely cooked it. Interviewer and I built a genuine connection and he started sharing anecdotes about his time there. He told me I'd be a great fit on campus.

**Comments:**  
I think I did pretty well for myself, especially given that I couldn't afford to spend anything on my ECs, so I couldn't do any major projects, and I didn't have external help with applications.  
I think my school's reputation nerfed me, and I could've done slightly better otherwise.

College counselor - good relationship, helped me so much with my applications, estimated rating: 8.5/10

State Representative (x2) - likely pretty basic/general letters of rec, estimated ratings: 5/10 and 7/10

**Interviews**

TBH I don't remember these that well, so take with a grain of salt:

* Princeton: 8.5/10, don't remember that much about it
* MIT: 6/10, kind of awkward, at the guy's condo and he asked me some odd questions (""are you a citizen?"")
* Dartmouth: 7.5/10, nice guy, but it was over Zoom and for some reason the connection was really bad so it froze up a lot... but it was good when we understood each other (apparently REALLY good, after I (spoiler) got rejected, he emailed me to tell me he was sorry to hear that happened because I was the best one he'd interviewed--which was also funny because he interviewed my friend too and he at least got waitlisted lol)
* Harvard: 7.5/10, nice guy, had a solid convo but nothing special
* Rice: 8.5/10, nice guy, via Zoom, we connected about playing baseball

**Essays**

Okay so I wrote 55(!!!) essays and will give you the best brief overview:

* Common app: 7.5/10, I thought it was okay, I just really struggled to find a good topic to write about (lots of what I had to say felt basic, and what wasn't basic I really just didn't want to share not only with the colleges, but with my teachers and parents when they read the essay); ended up writing about anxiety and how that affected me, ultimately felt like it came out decent but still felt pretty cliche and simplified
* Others: I obviously couldn't spend a huge amount of time on each essay, but I did plan my time well and write them over the course of about six months, so they weren't like rushed rushed and I did have both my English teacher and college counselor read over them and make edits (often multiple drafts) before submission. Overall probably around 8/10 on average, but some really great ones for sure

* Yale University
* Harvard University
* University of Pennsylvania
* Brown University
* Dartmouth University
* MIT

**Additional Information:**

I applied to so many schools (16) because I was originally planning to play baseball in college--I had started the recruiting process but had an injury that cost me almost a full year (spring of junior year to the beginning of the spring of senior year), which would've been my best time to hopefully be recruited. So, the plan was to wait until I was healthy again in spring of my senior year to hope to get some last-minute looks. Thus, I applied to a wide range of schools encompassing possible options for baseball and non-baseball, but ended up deciding before results came out to hang up the cleats rather than push to keep playing.

My top 3 going in were Princeton, Yale, and UF. Although it hurt to be rejected by so many, I was still very happy with where I ended up :)

1km53yu,Homeless Orphan With Insane EC’s Rejected From All But 2 Colleges,"My mom abandoned me when I was young and my dad died at the beginning of my senior year. Since I don’t have any legal parents or guardians now, my school district declared that I am a homeless orphan and I reflected that on my applications.

I’m disappointed with the results of my acceptances. I think I should have applied to more safety/target schools, but I’m happy with where I’m going.

**Demographics**

**Intended Major(s)**: Double Major in Business Management and Corporate Law

**Academics**

* GPA: 3.6UW/3.75W

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. One of the highest ranking Eagle Scouts in the United States. I held a high ranking international leadership position, representing the Boy Scouts of America at World Organization of the Scouting Movement Conferences.
2. Founder and President of a school club. Grew it to 160 members by senior year, with 60 unique weekly attendees. Held 3 meetings/week (business skill developments, investment workshops, and alternating speciality skill/guest speaker workshops). I also obtained multiple corporate sponsorships for my club.
3. Local Scouting. Eagle Scout with 50 merit badges. 140 camping nights. Junior Assistant Scoutmaster and Eagle Scout Coach. Personally raised $3,000/year in fundraisers, and helped dozens of boys and girls to get their Eagle Scout award.
4. Founded an Edtech startup with 20+ employees. Ultimately had to shut down after a giant education conglomerate targeted all of our prospective client schools and undercut our bids by offering obnoxiously low discounted pricing.
5. Created and installed a permanent educational installation at my state’s natural history museum. Ironically, I got waitlisted from the university that owns the museum.
6. DECA. Made it to state 3 times, consistently getting high testing scores and just barely missing the cutoff for state finals and nationals.
7. Community Service Letter. Lettered in community service from my school 3 years in a row with over 2,000 service hours.
8. Ceremonies staff for my school district. Helped coordinate graduation and Veterans Day ceremonies for all 4 years of high school.
9. Latin Club. Meh, nothing special. Showed up for 3 years, learned some Latin, passed my STAMP test, and then stopped going.
10. Mock Shark Tank. Runner-up in my school district’s version of Shark Tank. It got me my first client for my Ed tech startup.

**Letters of Recommendation**
* 11th & 12th English teacher: Strong relationship. I was asked to enroll in her invite-only dual enrollment class for 12th, and she’s a fantastic writer.
* 9th Government teacher and Club Advisor: There wasn’t much content to write about for my government performance, but she wrote a fantastic letter about my work ethic and ambition in my club.
* Counselor: Wrote about my extenuating family and personal circumstances.
* WOSM Advisor: Senior National Scouting Leader that acted as my supervisor and primary point of contact with the Boy Scouts of America for my international correspondence role. One of the most well-written men I’ve ever met, I’m sure he wrote a glowing letter of rec.
* School Board Director: Wrote about my impact on my school and city through my work in Scouting, and how I personally helped her son get his Eagle Scout rank.

**Essays**
My personal statement was about how I’ve developed my leadership skills over the years. I became an Eagle Scout at 13, started a company at 14, and started a club at 15. I discussed how those experiences shaped my leadership style, for better or for worse, and how I like to empower those around me in my current leadership roles.

**Letters of Recommendation**

I have read none of these letters unfortunately...

* *Counselor* \- 6/10
   * 9th-12th grade
   * I make efforts to try and connect during meetings, but never felt like I had a chance to get super close with her
   * counselor frequently asked for rec letters
   * counselor knows me a little better than most students, likely gave decent but generic letter (unique interest, taking initiative, hard work)
* *Physics* \- 7/10 
   * 11th grade
   * I was 1 out of 6 juniors in physics (\~50 total physics students) 
   * Consistently hard working in her class, relatively high scoring
   * teacher frequently asked for rec letters
   * teacher knows me better than most students, likely gave a decent but generic letter (hard work, perseverance?) 
* *Art* \- 9/10
   * 8th-9th, 11th grade
   * I was one of the only art students in the school who consistently put in effort
   * asked for aid from teacher throughout application process
   * teacher does not frequently get asked for rec letters
   * teacher knows me very well, likely gave a good letter (responsibility, accountability, hard working?) 
* *Art (Studio*) - 8/10
   * 4th-12th grade
   * I put in above average work in teacher's class
   * teacher often gets asked for rec letters
   * I have asked for rec letters from him before
   * teacher is family friend, likely gave good letter (emphasis on skill, leadership, personal journey/growth?) 
* *Internship* \- 7?/10
   * 12th grade
   * Family friend/professor at relatively well known art school
   * does not frequently give rec letters
   * likely gave decent letter (hard working, skill, experience) 



**~~Interviews~~**  **Portfolio review day interactions**

Most of these schools don't have specific architecture portfolio feedback, so I asked to be evaluated as a fine arts/illustration major. 

* *Drexel* \- 6/10
   * Cookie cutter responses and feedback
   * Confirmed I would most likely get in, but I felt bored during the conversation 
* *Syracuse* \- 9/10
   * agent was the department head of illustration
   * Really loved my pieces, said I ""stood out"", gave minimal but consistent feedback
   * gave me his contacts and promised to send my information to the department head of architecture, and then ghosted me
* *Parsons* \- 6.5/10
   * I don't remember anything from this conversation so it was probably generic
   * mildly useful feedback
* *Pratt* \- 8/10
   * Connected with agent on a personal level, talked about precollege experience with me
   * seemed to like my portfolio, felt that I was a good fit for the school
   * useful feedback 
* *CCA* \- 10/10 
   * Scarily enthusiastic
   * agent implied I had a shot at their full ride merit scholarship if I applied? (he got fired a few months later though and I didn't get the scholarship in the end)
* *RISD* \- 3/10
   * Online portfolio reviews
   * Minimal feedback, manned mostly by students and not AOs
   * So rude... the first agent laughed at my pieces
   * If there is one takeaway from this post, it is that you should go into the RISD portfolio review with thick skin and zero expectation of useful new information
* *Tufts (SMFA)* \- 8/10
   * definitely took PR training, optimistic but never promised anything 
   * encouraged me to talk about pieces, very attentive 
   * great feedback 
* *CMU* \- 6/10
   * School of Arts agent while I was applying as School of Architecture
   * quick interview due to time constraints
   * Thought that I could apply for Arts, Architecture or Design 
   * Appeared to take positive notes, but likely had no impact on my admissions process



**Essays**

*Personal Statement (8*.5*/10)*: Talked about museum sketching (niche hobby). Leaned into themes about international/dual identity, fine arts interest, hints of mental health. Good, well rounded unique essay which I am pretty proud of. 

*Supplements:* I had a few essays lined up that I can snip pieces out of to fulfill supplements.

* *Diversity (8/10)*: Dual identity, finding a place of belonging, etc. Decent essay, but hard to get my point across if colleges required it to be truncated below 300 words. 
* *Why Major (7.5/10)*: Leaned hard into envir. sci + fine arts -> architecture interest, looking for a multidisciplinary education. Could smoothly transition into ""why school"" segment at the end. 
* *Goals (7/10):* envir. sci focus, international experience, outlines plans for future masters degree overseas. Shows good planning and initiative. Could also transition into ""why school"" segment. 
* *Role Model (8/10):* Kengo Kuma, Japanese architect who specializes in sustainable design. Highlights envir. sci + architecture focus, international differences, current global events/issues. Could be truncated and added onto the second half of ""why major"" and ""goals"" essay to reinforce their themes. 
* *Leadership (5/10):* Orchestra first chair experience, shows strength and a mindset improvement. Overall my weakest essay, not really connected to any other parts of my application.

*DNE Applications:*

   * Home Test was such a headache and I didn't have enough time 
* Syracuse (RD)
   * genuinely forgot to put the portfolio in

**Additional Information:**

* Most colleges gave me decent scholarship due to financial situation + merit aid. The highest aid packages were given by Drexel, RPI, and Tufts. 
* I applied a good mix of art schools and T20/30 research schools so I would have good options when it came down to committing. I prioritized applying to schools that offered the B.Arch pre-professional program, since it is very useful for my future career path. 
* My application leaned towards ""fine arts applicant"" with standout good grades, so I was unsurprised when I mostly got into art schools. 
* I was forced to ED to Cornell by my parents, but I am mostly ambivalent towards the school itself. In terms of regrets, I think I should have prioritized the Cornell app a little more, since I think I do have a chance at getting in. Cornell also loves our HS so that would have helped too. However, I'm not super upset at missing Ithaca weather. 
* The decision came down to choosing between 
   * UMass (Honors college research, decent aid, 4+2 M.Arch masters program)
   * Pratt (good aid, high ranking architecture school, brooklyn/NYC access)
   * Tufts (high ranking school overall, Combined Degree versatility, Boston access)
   * RISD if I get off the waitlist (high ranking art/architecture school, Brown proximity, friends) 

  
I ended up committing to Tufts because they suddenly gave us a huge financial aid package (near full ride). The location is good, I could choose to go into either environmental science, architecture, or fine arts careers in the future, the connections, and the students looked happy there. 

Overall, decent outcome!

I prioritized applying to schools that offered the B.Arch pre-professional program, since it is very useful for my future career path., My application leaned towards ""fine arts applicant"" with standout good grades, so I was unsurprised when I mostly got into art schools., I was forced to ED to Cornell by my parents, but I am mostly ambivalent towards the school itself. In terms of regrets, I think I should have prioritized the Cornell app a little more, since I think I do have a chance at getting in. Cornell also loves our HS so that would have helped too.

1klkxwt,"No crazy stats, got lucky?????","I've been seeing people with 20+ acceptances with multiple ivies and I feel like some people might be discouraged by that. So I thought I'd share my relatively normal stats and results because I did end up getting into my dream school.
I either applied to CS or business/finance or both if they had an integrated program.

Demographics:

• Gender: Female
• Race/Ethnicity: Asian
• Residence: International (one of the poorer countries in asia), US citizenship
• Income bracket: Wayy below 70k, but I think we're middle class in our country
• Type of school: Small private school
• Hooks: low-income?? (I think I count), geographic, learning on merit based scholarships since 3rd grade 

Academics:

• GPA: 99/100 unweighted
• Rank: 1/50
• AP/IB/Honors/etc: Our school only offered elective courses, I took 3 which was the max
• SAT: Took it 3 times, 1480, 1430, 1420 (lol they just got worse overtime) but my highest math was 790 and highest RW was 700.
• College Courses: While taking a gap year, I decided to enroll in college and I was taking an accounting, marketing, psychology and a really hard calculus course during app season. Planned courses were: finance, management, law 101, statistics, politics. My first semester GPA was a 3.7.
• I also studied a foreign language beside english for 6 years.

Extracurriculars/Activities

• Stock trading for a long time but with no grand achievement 
• Coded a stock finder using ai 
• Harvard cs50
• A passion project, taught basic coding
• Leadership in volunteering (+100 people)
• Theater 
• Student government
• Volleyball (not an athlete tho)
• Highschool level research with real implementation 

Awards/Honors:

• Full ride scholarship for a slightly competitve university during junior year
• Also received a scholarship from a national university during senior year
• Scholarships from school 
• Grand prize for a regional speaking contest
• Another smaller prize for another regional speaking contest

Letters of Recommendation:

Counselor: Nothing too serious but she likes me (6/10)
Homeroom teacher: We've been through alot together, and I'd go as far as to call her my second mother (9/10)
Math teacher: She has taught me for 6 years and I think she has always liked me as a student (8/10)

Interviews:
None yay

Essays:

Personal essay: An extremely abstract story about me finding purpose. It was honestly a hit or miss. I think after reading my essay the admissions officers either thought I was a witty genius or a mess.
Supplemental essays: I started and finished most of them on the day of the deadline. But I guess once you have one finished the rest are easy. But I would say they were pretty neat overall.

Acceptances:

• University of Vermont with 100k Presidential scholarship
• University of Washington with 5.4k per year Purple & Gold scholarship 
• Carnegie Mellon University  (SCS and commited)

Waitlists:

• WashU
• Lafayette College

Rejections:

• Upenn
• Columbia
• NYU
• USC

Conclusion:
1) I know I got pretty lucky with my results, and I have no idea how I managed to get into a top CS school. 
2) The outcomes of college applications are so so unpredictable. 
And finally, to anyone who is worrying about their applications, even if you don't have the perfect stats, I'd say just shoot your shot.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Biology teacher (7/10) - was a good student in class, and he was also the advisor for a couple of the clubs I was a part of so was probably able to speak well on my love for science as well as my character. Giving this a 7/10 just because a lot of people ask for LOR's every year and idk if the quality was amazing or anything

Language teacher (8.5/10) - been in the class for 4 years, pretty active student and close to the teacher. She also wrote my LOR for COSMOS and I was able to get in so I'm assuming the LOR for college was also good lol. 

  
Research PI (8/10) - from the lab I did my research internship at, had a good relationship with the PI and was able to showcase my drive/motivation and I think they were probably able to write about it pretty well too. 

  
Professor I worked with for activity #3 (6.5/10) - they definitely had a lot to say about my involvement especially because I played a big role in the organization but they're also extremely busy so I kinda had to self-write a bit and they would fill in the rest? and my self-writing wasn't really the best so i'm assuming it was a pretty generic LOR. 

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Didn't do a single interview, lowkey just lost motivation for this ngl 

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I think my UC essays were pretty good, my personal statement was pretty mid though along with all of the ivy league supplementals because I really didn't care enough to try hard on them. I liked my UC essays the best, just because I think it allowed me to give the best range of who I am as a person.

Closing thoughts: Had I gotten into any better school than UCSD, I would have stuck with economics as my major. Only after my rejections did I spend the time to reflect on myself and what I wanted, and I realized that economics was not what I truly wanted to do. The ""investment banking"" dream that I had in mind was not a life that I would be happy and feel fulfilled living. After finding out at UCSD that there were a plethora of majors that I could switch to without any problems, I ended up switching into ""bioinformatics"", a major that fascinates me and that UCSD is world-renowned for. I can't vouch for everyone, but in my case, rejection is truly redirection.

Also, one thing that I tried to make clear in my college apps was that I wasn't really playing the ""college game"" (though in 12th grade, I realized that I had to do these activities to maximize my chances at my dream school). In fact, rather than writing a very quirky and unique essay like you are supposed to, I wrote about my passionate pursuit of my sport in my personal statement, and this clearly wasn't the right move. My point is that everyone tells you to be authentic in your college apps, as your ""true self"" will shine through, but this is rarely the case. Build that club that sounds impressive, do that research internship that you're not passionate about. College apps don't reward the honest and the authentic; they reward people who play the ""college game.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kktd81/getting_rejected_by_dream_school_was_the_best/,1747058742,1530,,3.879608068,East Asian,,,"Hooks, AP Courses (currently taking), Closing thoughts",Male

Psychology Prof: I didn't see it, but I suspect it was very good. Worked with the professor on a school project, and she asked me what she would like me to highlight.

Literature Prof: I haven't read it, and it was very last minute, but I trust this professor, and we worked together on the literary club.

Put effort getting to know my profs, went to office ours, clubs etc.

**Interviews**

Yale Eli Whitney Students Program: I did pretty well. It was very laid-back. She asked questions about why I joined various organizations and what my favorite classes were. The only semi-testing question was how I manage subjects that are challenging or not as enjoyable for me (for me, it's math).

**Essays**

1: Personal Statement: Talked about hard lessons I have learned over the years and how I can share that wisdom with fellow students. I was honest that I have experienced a lot of sad situations, but explained that I would rather be aware of the ugly side of life than just be ignorant or naive. For military-specific prompts, I explained how my military training as an analyst prepared me for academia. An important part of my essay was that I am a survivor of an overseas mass casualty incident, and my soul searching from that.

3: Why Major: Talked about how my military service overseas expanded my perspective on how we can change our political and cultural frameworks in the US, or how my experience in gov has motivated me in pursuing how gov can be used to help people. I was VERY specific about what topics I wanted to research and explore.

Writing Sample: political philosophy essay that I am very proud of, has very good comments from Prof etc. ""one of best intros from a student""

Additional Information: I got help from the Warrior Scholars Project and Service 2 School. I highly recommend you reach out to them!! In general, I think I did a bit more extracurriculars than many veterans who are transferring. It might not have been necessary, but I didn't want to leave anything to chance, so I just did everything I could. Everyone has their own path and responsibilities.

Additional Information
• I was second time applicant as was made to apply to college in junior year since my school needs its acceptance to college rate at 100%. I was given a TO to Cornell and was told to reapply after explaining the situation instead of recommending me going to a diff college and not doing exchange. Maybe Cornell is just calling me idk
• Early grad but also skipped a year
• I know one of my teachers wrote about seeing  me develop though HS and how I did really well right after Covid despite others falling off. Maybe this along with the fact that I did better on higher level AP on AP I did worse on first time. I took lit after lang.

**Intended Major(s)**: Mathematics 

**Academics**

* GPA (UW): 4.0 (95 credits)
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 6 APs
* Relevant Coursework:
   * Lower Division (All Honors)
      * Multivariable Calculus
      * Linear Algebra 
      * Differential Equations 
      * Discrete Mathematics
      * Elementary Statistics

   * Other
      * Computer and Network Analysis
      * Network Intrusion 

**NOTE:**

While the coursework may seem a great deal, the lower division coursework you see was completed by the time I graduated high school, prior to my enlistment. I was dual-enrolled at a community college and in addition to credit from other classes and AP exams, I was pretty much able to get my associate’s degree right out of high school.

While serving, I still had a deep and vested interest in mathematics so I pursued my undergraduate degree in mathematics. But to be honest, the universities I am transferring to will most likely NOT take my upper division courses as credit, and I’ll have to redo them (which is okay by me). These courses came from an online college, which was the only way I could study while deployed/working full-time, so they are definitely not as rigorous or comprehensive.

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

* SAT Subject Tests (Not like it matters anymore, but it was on my application):
   * Math: 800

**NOTE:** 

The scores you see on here are wildly outdated. I took all of these tests prior to my enlistment, while I was still in high school, and since then have not taken any new tests. I applied for Fall of 2025 so… make of these as you will. 

I applied test optional to all schools, except the ones that required it.

**Letters of Recommendation (no UC allows LOR)**

1. Philo professor: would rate it 9/10? he let me read it and i thought it was really good, he said out of his years of teaching i am top 10 student he had lol. but it was very short so i'm not sure if this is good or not.
2. Shift Lead LOR: wrote me one, i didn't really need it but i thought it doesn't hurt. i thought it was very professional but i don't think it made an impact necessarily. 5/10?

**Essays**

UC Essays: First two essays were SOLID and I am very proud of them. Extremely personal but very true to me!! Talked about queer identity, being mixed race, how I overcame being a shit student, hardships of working full-time. Third essay was fine, but fourth essay was shit lol.

Pitzer Essay: I thought it was really good and the best one. Very tailored to the school.

NEU and Colby: Okay but not good.

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

Waiting on: Colby College and Northeastern but will be committing to UC Irvine!!

**Additional Information:**

okay my gpa situation! at the time of submitting my uc app, my gpa was a 2.79 but during the fall i got academic renewal completed and my gpa changed to a 3.1 . however i could not update this in my TAU so basically the uc's evaluated my application as a 2.79 gpa. in the fall i took 21 credits but got 3 C's which i thought messed up my chances of admissions. i think overall i had 12 W's and even more F's and D's on my transcript. i'm so glad and will be committing to UC irvine as an urban studies major!!!

hella sad that waitlisted berkelely applicants cannot add additional information or a loci because i would have explained my gpa/academic renewal situation. since i was rejected from ucla, i'm considering appealing just for the hell of it since i technically do have new info that makes me a stronger student.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kj1pjh/279_gpa_somehow_bags_a_uc_ccc_transfer/,1746850567,,21,2.79,Asian,"UC Riverside, UC Merced, UC Santa Cruz (was SO happy! i knew that if i got into ucsc that i would be very happy and could feel fulfilled here, plus i love the campus), **UC IRVINE!!!!!!!!!!!**","**UC Berkeley** (WTF!!!!!!! applied for impacted major, wish i had applied for less impacted one lmao), UC Davis (was my dream school at some point so hella sad i was WL), UC Santa Barbara","UC Los Angeles, Pitzer (i thought my essays were great and very well tailored to the school. my low gpa definitely got me turned away and i'm sure there were students with much higher gpa's that looked better), Waiting on: Colby College and Northeastern but will be committing to UC Irvine!!, Additional Information:**",Male
1kj10ox,Asian Immigrant Veteran Gets Raw-Dogged by College Admissions... But Still Finishes With a Happy Ending,"**FOREWORD: This is a transfer post.**

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian
* Residence: Texas
* Income Bracket: The lowest one
* Type of School: Community College
* Hooks: Veteran, First Gen College, Immigrant, low-income.

**Intended Major(s)**: Economics/Math

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.1 HS back in 2018, 3.94 at CC
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: None
* Senior Year Course Load: N/A

**Standardized Testing**

*N/A*, did not take SAT/ACT

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc*

**Note: Most of my ECs are done within the military**

1. 4 years in the United States Marine Corps
2. Held the highest leadership role attainable for my job for 2 years, in charge of 10+ Marines.
3. Created personal finance workshops for Marines, totaling more than $10k saved and $10k in debts paid off.

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. A few military awards, but they're not very significant.

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. Battalion Commander (7/10): Somewhat generic, but it did its job by validating my statements.
2. Platoon Commander: (9/10): I worked closely under him for a little over a year, during which he saw my progression as a Marine leader/individual, and did a good job explaining why I stood out to others.
3. English Professor: (?/10): Haven't had a chance to read it, will update if I have the chance.
4. Biology Professor: (100/10): Honestly what a perfect recommendation letter should look like, she wrote a letter that is very personal and beautifully describes my academic relationship with her from the beginning of the semester til the end. She used actual events that happened to help paint a picture of who I am as a student in an academic environment. I believe her LOR contributed greatly.

**Interviews**

Yale Eli Whitney Students Program (10/10): I genuinely enjoyed my interview with Yale's AO. The interview was very casual, and the questions asked were mostly what I wrote in my essay, just more in-depth. She was very welcoming and made me feel confident about a positive decision.

**Essays**

1: Personal Statement: I wrote about my life journey, from coming to the states as an immigrant, grappling with racism and being isolated in HS, to finding a sense of belonging in the military, to finally igniting my passion to pursue higher education. One of my favorite essays.

2: Princeton's ""Lived Experience"" Essay: An elaboration on my understanding of nationality and identity, being an ""1.5 generation"" immigrant changed the way I viewed the world. My development and maturity have grown throughout the years, from the confusion of being introduced to the concept of race for the first time, to denying who I am to fit in, to eventually openly rejoicing with my culture, and accepting myself. Had a lot of introspection with this one and it was very personal and fun.

3: Why Major: I wrote about the lack of financial literacy in the military and how I realized it was important for me to gain more knowledge in order to promote financial literacy on a bigger scale.

10/10 PreCalc/Trig + Calc I Teacher

He is a really enthusiastic person that truly sees the best in everyone. His letter was so raving that I didn't get past the first paragraph.

7/10 Senior English Teacher

She said positive things about me, but it wasn't anything special. She described me as a good writer which may have helped me get into the school I will be attending.

7/10 Honors Physic + AP Physics Teacher

I asked him to include bits about my personality since I knew the other ones were so academically based and sort of fades into the background of all the other students' LoRs. I am most myself with him and ran ESports.

6/10 Homeroom Teacher (Librarian I interned for)

Very kind, but seemingly rushed and short. Spoke more of feeling confident about our future if kids like me are in charge. 



**Interviews**

None



**Essays**

*I wrote my essays in waves. I definitely got better the second times around.*

*Personal Statement (8/10)- How I inherently view the world differently as a trans person and will contribute to an academic setting. I had some really beautiful analogies about what it's like to be queer and my connection to nature through my identity. I really wanted to go to a school surrounded by trails/nature (I love the environment).*

*Major Essays (7/10) - I wrote about how my interests in the arts and math are related. I find both creatively fufilling and intend to double major/minor in music. I also used to dance and I still paint and photograph. I went to an arts magnet in elementary school and you wouldn't know me properly without understanding the role the arts has in my upbringing and way of thinking.*

Overall Comment: I had lots of strong ECs, especially with lots of leadership positions at school clubs and organizations. My school media teacher also told me that I ""revitalized"" the school's media program and I bet he wrote that in my LOCI as well. My research was also really strong, although it was my first research I'd done in my life.

**Letters of Recommendation**

* AP Seminar, AP Research, English Teacher (8/10)
* 10th Grade Chemistry Teacher (7/10)
* AP Psychology, Social Science, Media Teacher (9.5/10)
* School Headmaster (7/10)
* Research Advisor (local university professor) (10/10)

Overall Comment: Overall, I had really good relationships with my teachers. My AP research teacher, for example, goes around advertising how the research I started in his AP research class ended up winning multiple science fairs and got featured in a national newspaper. My media teacher also told me I ""revitalized"" the school's media program and my research advisor (who's a professor at a local university) told me that I was the first high school student that emailed him for research opportunities at his lab (in Korea this isn't common) and had really positive impressions on me. He showed me the letter he wrote and it sounded really genuine and advocated for how my research was actually done myself from the start to the end.

**Interviews**

* Dartmouth (Alumni Interview, 6/10)
* Stanford (Alumni Interview, 7/10)
* UPenn (Alumni Interview, 6/10)

Overall Comment: I'm really bad at interviews, but whenever the interviewer brought up things about my research, I probably talked too much about it in too much detail (the interviewers seemed bored by the time I finished talking).

* Rank (or percentile): 4/400
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 12 APs
* Senior Year Course Load: (I took a gap year btw, so I graduated last year) band, AP stats, macro, gov, music theory, English lit

* AP/IB: 5’s on hug, physics I and II, wh, apush, lang, calc ab, gov, macro, music theory, stats, 4 on lit

**Extracurriculars**

My school has a pretty strong band program overall, we’ve placed well in national competitions in various ensembles. Our marching band was ranked in like the top 25 recently I think.

1. Marching band for 4 years, leadership for 2 years.
2. 1st chair trumpet in top concert band, music librarian
3. Co-lead trumpet in top jazz band
4. Principal trumpet in local youth orchestra, and school orchestra
5. Volunteered teaching middle schoolers how to march and private music lessons
6. During school I worked a job a few hours a week.

As I’ve mentioned, I’m currently in my gap year. I didn’t even apply to college last year. I actually wanted to do music for a long time, but then changed my mind once I graduated. 

I took a gap year for quite a few reasons. I firstly was just not ready to apply to college. I didn’t even know what the common app was until like October. I tried to get things together, but was super overwhelmed. Other reasons include financial, I lost a bunch of money, my parents can’t afford to help pay for college, and I also needed time to get away from my mildly transphobic family and focus on my transition.

During the summer of my gap year I got my class A CDL and I’ve been working full time at the same company I joined at 16. I do some mildly technical work in terms of basic vehicle maintenance and inspection, drive semi/forklifts, warehouse management. I also still play trumpet. I played a bit in a local professional group, local queer friendly church,  and a band and orchestra at a local university. Also marched as an alum in a prestigious event (trying to be vague). Also been focusing on my transition more, and got involved in a bit of queer activism.

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. School jazz award, senior voted by peers

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Band teacher 9/10
Calc teacher 8/10
Counselor 5/10

I didn’t read them, but was very close with my band director obviously. He’s been a huge inspiration of mine, and he got to see a lot of growth in me over the years. I actually started freshman year as a pretty terrible student. I would skip band rehearsals and stuff (it was covid so easy excuses), but I learned a lot and his graciousness and kindness have been incredibly valuable throughout my high school career.

I wasn’t super close with my calc teacher, but I was a good student. I sat by the front, I would ask questions, often did my stuff pretty quickly. I told her I got into mit, and she said I was one of the best students in her career, so that was surprising.

Kinda close with my counselor? I did talk to him somewhat extensively about some mental health stuff and asked for help with applying to school after graduation. But, he has had trouble using the correct name and pronouns for me (I came out over 4 years ago), so idk.

**Interviews**

Only had two

Princeton 6/10: idk, went ok ig, we talked about med school a good bit since he’s there rn I think, I was kinda awkward and nervous though. Nothing to really say here.

MIT 9/10: idk how important the interview is, but I think it went pretty well. My interviewer graduated last year, and she was kinda awkward as a result, but weirdly that made me feel more comfortable? She asked questions based on the mit blog about “what we look for”, and I think that was super useful in giving answers that put my best foot forward.

Also side note, I was assigned to a different mit interviewer at first, but she was kind of insane. She has a crazy website. I asked to be reassigned (I worried about transphobia) Idk if admissions knew I asked, but idk if it matters.

**Essays**

Common app essay was about like being trans and how I uplifted people in band and created a more inclusive culture. I had my lit teacher go over it and she really liked it.

The supplemental grind was actually crazy. Literally a 40 page document. I wrote quite a bit of stuff about being queer, how growing up in a red state and largely non-supportive environment I had to learn most things on my own, and wanting to improve queer healthcare. Also wrote some stuff about music obviously.

I also wrote quite a bit in additional info about extenuating circumstances. Freshman year mental health, some financial circumstances, unsupportive family.

1ker93j,Indian International Student Applies ONLY REACHES... Wins by a whisker,"2024-2025 was one wild ride. I played a game that my school counselor, my parents, and my friends thought was really crazy. And they're right. I applied to 13 unis in the states. Every. Single. One was a T15, Ivy+ uni. I had two ""safeties"" in Europe, but those were Bocconi and the Stockholm School of Economics... which are technically \~10% acceptance too (so not rly safety ig) but I had a lil feeling in my gut that I'd 100% get into those. So yeah, here's my story. I applied Princeton REA, and I applied to just about every single Ivy and top college else that you can think of in RD.

I'm an Indian international male with pretty much no hooks and my grades aren't even all that mind boggling I guess. In the end, all I wanted was one win. Just one. One would be enough to set me for life, so I decided to just play a numbers game and shotgun all of them. \~5% acceptance rate, 13 unis? If I'm just going to give myself a 5% shot at each, that would mean I've got a 48.67% of getting into at least one life changing school right? And if I'm any better than average, those numbers get even better. I like those odds.

I learnt through the process that the numbers don't quite work like that, and that online college chancers are super bogus, but that's a talk for another day. For now, here's me:

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Indian
* Residence: Middle East
* Income Bracket: \~120K
* Type of School: Private International School
* Hooks: Pretty much none... I've lived in four countries... but applying from an international school in the ME, that's lowk not a hook.

**Intended Major(s)**: Econ

**Academics**

* GPA (UW): 3.92/4.0
* IB Predicted: 44/45
* Rank (or percentile): Unranked
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 2 AP classes in soph year + full IB Diploma
* Senior Year Course Load: (full IB)
   * HL: Econ, Physics, English LL
   * SL: Math AA, ESS, Spanish ab initio

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

* SAT: 1530 (750RW, 780M)
* AP/IB: AP US History (5), AP Computer Science P (5); haven't taken final IB exams yet... (but yes reported PG 44/45)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*Yeah... these seem all over the place but they're generally grouped into 1. finance/economics, 2. cs/or startup ventures solving some overarching social issue (most of the time), 3. martial arts and hobbies that I took to a decently far level*

1. *founder and co-chief editor of a finance publication with > 1M total reads and \~70k words*
2. founder & solo developer of an iOS social media app aimed to create an online fitness & health community, \~25k lines of code & \~400 users... had to learn two coding languages from scratch to make this and it took hundreds of hours
3. founder & co-president of the school's finance club: created the full curriculum from scratch, had about \~25 members and biweekly meetings
4. developed a stock price predicting AI model that was accurate compared to actual values in the next 5 mins within ±0.1 USD 96% and ±0.01 USD 36% of the time
5. treasurer for a local student led environmental org, created budgets for events like mangrove planting & greenhouse development
6. karate black belt with 3 A-grade distinctions and a 39-4 sparring record
7. co-founder and writer of a martial arts blog with > 250k reads and \~20k words published... making the first one taught me lessons that helped a lot
8. monetized YT creator making videos on Rubik's cubes, > 500k views and 3k subs
9. learnt full stack web development and developed websites for the small family business, for a local musician, and a small architecture firm
10. paid intern at a small hedge fund where I designed videos and infographics illustrating their investing strategy

**Awards/Honors**

*I had next to nothing for this... def the weakest part of my application*

1. Top Ten Finalist in a large financial consulting competition (3000+ Participants)
2. (school award) 2x Winner, Exemplary Service Award
3. (school award) 2x Winner, Excellence in English Award
4. (school award) Winner, Excellence in Social Studies Award
5. Finalist for a really competitive & prestigious school award that offers a cash prize & lots of opportunities, awarded for service, community building etc...

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. English Teacher (10/10) - I LOVE my english teacher and we've got a good relationship... she was really happy to write my letter and ran it past the whole english faculty to make it perfect before sending.
2. Econ Teacher (9/10) - Known my econ teacher since 9th grade, and he was the advisor for two of my school clubs... so he had a lot of good things to say about me. I'm sure it was great.
3. Math Teacher (7.5/10) - He wrote a really good letter, I think... he does really like me and I'm the hardest working kid in his class. My counselor said it was good too, but that the first two were stellar and I should prioritize those.

**Interviews**

1. Princeton (8/10) - my dream school and my first interview. Interviewer was really cool and majored in the same pretty niche major I wanted at P-ton, ORFE, so that was awesome. I do think I talked too much and didn't ask quite enough questions though.
2. Stanford (9/10) - this was a GOOD interview. It came a little later in the year and by then I was a little more confident and self assured, and this helped a lot in the interview. I asked lots of questions and I'm sure he enjoyed the convo.
3. Penn (8/10) - Generally good, asked the guy a LOT of questions and learnt a lot, we had an engaging talk. It did feel a little rushed though.

**Essays**

* Common App Essay (8/10): Wrote about an entire summer I spent making bows for no particular reason, but how it embodied my deepest character trait - I'm a creator. I just have a restless itch to create cool things and see them through, whether it's bows or apps or startups. Pretty good but ngl could've had more substance if I thought it through more.
* Harvard (8/10): well written but not very unique
* Princeton (7/10): P-ton you were my dream but it's okay. Essays were defo worse quality here than everywhere else, just generally lacking a distinctive voice (because I sent REA. learnt lessons from this that I used everywhere else)
* Yale (8/10): Mannn I liked these essays but I guess they didn't really stand out too much... pro tip, just referencing res colleges at Yale and talking about being a Trumbullian and joining the Tyng cup may not be enough.
* Columbia (9/10): Honestly I was pretty shocked when I saw I didn't get into Columbia... I know I shouldn't be surprised when it comes to not getting into any of these schls but it did surprise me a little because I thought these were ON POINT. I loved my ""why Columbia"" and struggle essays - it made me bring out a more vulnerable side of myself.
* Cornell (9/10): Okay come on Cornell these were fire. I applied for Dyson with a second choice of the Hotel School so both must've read my app and said no but I really did go all out here, esp. since the Dyson essay is so damn long
* Brown (8/10): Can't lie, these were good but not exceptional
* UPenn (8/10): Applied for the Huntsman program for international management with the hook of trying to be a ""liason between American corporations and the Indian growth story"" or something like that since I'm an Indian who's spent his life abroad
* Stanford (7/10): Okay imma be real here, by the time I worked on Stanford I was kinda scared and applied for STS instead of Econ hoping that it would help my chances, but I do NOT RECOMMEND this strategy since it certainly weakened my essays because i kinda didn't know wth I was talking about.
* UCs (9/10): Okay these essays were really damn good. If I can't submit my SAT then you best believe I'm bringing my A-game to the essays
* UChicago (10/10): Okay my Chicago essays were actually lowk booker prize worthy.
   * The first quirky pick your own prompt one, I wrote to the prompt that's like ""pac man has 3 lives, elements have 1/2 lives, pick something and explain why it has as many lives as it does,"" and I wrote a whole philosophical exposition about the hardcore YOLO mode in call of duty infinite warfare and how Nick Reyes's mortality brings his life value, and how that extends to the human experience.
   * The other one about why UChi was also insane, i did everything that's usually in a why uni essay, like talking about cool courses, programs, etc. except I did it in a really cool and imagery infused day in the life format.

**Additional Information:**

*So yeah. That was my college application experience. Pretty wild imo... my parents were pulling their hair out the day before Ivy day, and I get it. I was pretty tense too, but I've always been a (calculated? smart?) risk taker. And I won, but just by a whisker.*

*I mean... when I think about it, it's hard to even believe. In the end, I got into UChicago, for RD, as an international. That would put my odds at around \~2%. And then think about me being an Indian male trying to major in econ. It's pretty shocking imo. It's the school I actually had the least faith in... lowk thought I had a better shot at Harvard since I missed ED1 and ED2 for UChi. But yeah, luck played out in my favor: I've got family in Chicago, and I actually love the school's vibe, class size, everything :).*

But wait up, getting into Chi wasn't that clear cut... I got waitlisted first. And I think the only reason I got in was a REALLY good LOCI. I sent it out the same day I got WL, and it was very bold. I didn't mention myself or my achievements or my growth. Rather, I nerded out about the history of chicago as a city, and then invited the AO to portillo's with me. And it worked.

So here's my takeaway: I applied to 13 schools. Every application I made, I got more and more genuine. I became realer and realer. Sometimes I still felt like finessing the system a little like I tried with Stanford STS instead of Econ, but life taught me that that isn't the way. Chicago was my most genuine app, and when I read it, I know that is me, distilled into a few hundred words. I'm proud of my journey, and more so of how it's made me look into myself and understand myself. Finally, I'm happy that every other school rejected or waitlisted me. It humbled my stupid often narcissistic self and taught me to appreciate what I have and what I earn, and that nothing is entitled to me even if the numbers would suggest so.

Thanks everybody out here on Reddit, a lot of your insights did help me out when I was looking into colleges, and if anybody's got any questions for me, I'll take em so lay them on.

I asked lots of questions and I'm sure he enjoyed the convo., 3. Penn (8/10) - Generally good, asked the guy a LOT of questions and learnt a lot, we had an engaging talk. It did feel a little rushed though., Essays**, Common App Essay (8/10): Wrote about an entire summer I spent making bows for no particular reason, but how it embodied my deepest character trait - I'm a creator. I just have a restless itch to create cool things and see them through, whether it's bows or apps or startups. Pretty good but ngl could've had more substance if I thought it through more., Harvard (8/10): well written but not very unique, Princeton (7/10): P-ton you were my dream but it's okay. Essays were defo worse quality here than everywhere else, just generally lacking a distinctive voice (because I sent REA. learnt lessons from this that I used everywhere else), Yale (8/10): Mannn I liked these essays but I guess they didn't really stand out too much... pro tip, just referencing res colleges at Yale and talking about being a Trumbullian and joining the Tyng cup may not be enough., Columbia (9/10): Honestly I was pretty shocked when I saw I didn't get into Columbia... I know I shouldn't be surprised when it comes to not getting into any of these schls but it did surprise me a little because I thought these were ON POINT. I loved my ""why Columbia"" and struggle essays - it made me bring out a more vulnerable side of myself., Cornell (9/10): Okay come on Cornell these were fire. I applied for Dyson with a second choice of the Hotel School so both must've read my app and said no but I really did go all out here, esp. since the Dyson essay is so damn long, Brown (8/10): Can't lie, these were good but not exceptional, UPenn (8/10): Applied for the Huntsman program for international management with the hook of trying to be a ""liason between American corporations and the Indian growth story"" or something like that since I'm an Indian who's spent his life abroad, Stanford (7/10): Okay imma be real here, by the time I worked on Stanford I was kinda scared and applied for STS instead of Econ hoping that it would help my chances, but I do NOT RECOMMEND this strategy since it certainly weakened my essays because i kinda didn't know wth I was talking about., UCs (9/10): Okay these essays were really damn good. If I can't submit my SAT then you best believe I'm bringing my A-game to the essays, UChicago (10/10): Okay my Chicago essays were actually lowk booker prize worthy., The first quirky pick your own prompt one, I wrote to the prompt that's like ""pac man has 3 lives, elements have 1/2 lives, pick something and explain why it has as many lives as it does,"" and I wrote a whole philosophical exposition about the hardcore YOLO mode in call of duty infinite warfare and how Nick Reyes's mortality brings his life value, and how that extends to the human experience., The other one about why UChi was also insane, i did everything that's usually in a why uni essay, like talking about cool courses, programs, etc. except I did it in a really cool and imagery infused day in the life format.","Waitlists:*, UChicago, UC Berkeley, UCLA","Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, UPenn, Stanford, Additional Information:**, So yeah. That was my college application experience. Pretty wild imo... my parents were pulling their hair out the day before Ivy day, and I get it. I was pretty tense too, but I've always been a (calculated? smart?) risk taker. And I won, but just by a whisker.*, I mean... when I think about it, it's hard to even believe. In the end, I got into UChicago, for RD, as an international. That would put my odds at around \~2%. And then think about me being an Indian male trying to major in econ. It's pretty shocking imo. It's the school I actually had the least faith in... lowk thought I had a better shot at Harvard since I missed ED1 and ED2 for UChi. But yeah, luck played out in my favor: I've got family in Chicago, and I actually love the school's vibe, class size, everything :).*",Male
1kdzwf2,Results from a very old person for comparison,"Quick note: Graduated in the early-mid 2010s. I was a recruited athlete, but I looked at my application package once i got to college. They noted that sports weren’t ultimately the primary reason for acceptance. Also, my teammates were by-and-large incredibly intelligent guys, who would’ve made it into good schools regardless. Should also note that, at the beginning of senior year \*edit: of high school\*, I nearly had a nervous breakdown due to the amount of pressure i put on myself. not an exaggeration. I almost forgot who I was for a brief period of time. In part, this was because of the realization that I hated the sport I got recruited to play. What are you gonna do?

1kdlm8x,"Applied to UCs as a joke, got accepted to all of them and stayed in Texas anyways.","These are my undergrad statistics, when I applied for college in 2021. I am currently a graduating masters' student who got grandfathered into my program as a 4+1 student. Thought I would share my story as someone who sucks at standardized testing and whose resume makes zero sense.

Disclaimer: Even though I got accepted to the UCs, I didn't end up attending them because the out-of-state tuition costs were too high.

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian
* Residence: Texas, but I had lived in California for the majority of my life.
* Income: My family was definitely low income at the time. We're better now.

* AP/IB:
   * **IB:** Received the IB diploma *after* applications (25/45 score).
   * **AP:** Received 4/5s on English and History AP exams, 3 in Psychology. Failed Macroeconomics because all my friends were in that class and I didn't pay attention. Didn't bother taking any math and science exams because I knew my limits.
* Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): Nope

**Extracurriculars/Activities:** Here we go, my fever dream of a resume/rap sheet. To this day, I question how on earth I managed to find all the time to fit this many sideplots.

\- Pre High School: I was in a STEM middle school and had some experience with robotics, programming, and engineering that did get mentioned in the college essays.

\- Freshman Year: Rocket Engineering, Journalism, JROTC (Marksmanship, Orienteering, Military Science focus), Alternative School (Oops)

\- Sophomore Year: Greco-Roman Wrestling. Speech (Improv) and Debate (Lincoln Douglas). Guitar.

\- Junior Year: Game Theory Club President, Arts Honors Officer. PBS Trivia Team. Continued Greco-Roman Wrestling and Speech and Debate.

\- Senior Year: :) Nothing because twas was 2020-2021.

**Awards/Honors:** 

I wasn't good enough at any of the mentioned above activities to actually win any awards. I did it all for the plot and not the trophy. I suppose I was in Honor Roll, but that's not really anything to write home about if everyone in your homeroom is also on the list.

My ECs are by far the weakest part of my application; I basically started all my main extracurriculars in sophomore year and I regret it, not necessarily because of how it impacted my college apps but because I could've discovered my passion for teaching math so much sooner.

1. Tutoring math at after-school program (3hr/day, 15hr/week).
2. Teaching math classes at the same after-school program, started by popular demand. We have scheduled ""activity blocks"" and kids can sign up for whatever activity they want, and I went from having 10 students to 30 students on a regular basis.
3. Co-captain of school's math team (3hr/week). I was on the team since freshman year but never showed up to practices and then had a major redemption arc in sophomore year, which is probably what got me appointed captain.
4. Started a school-wide Math + CS competition in collaboration with CS Club (11th grade, 2hr/week). We designed the problems so all of them could be solved by hand but participants were allowed to code solutions. After a lot of tireless recruiting we got around 70 participants and partnered with our local RSM to give out prizes.
5. Run an online math blog (technically started sophomore year, but worked on it a lot more as a junior, so it averages out to 3hr/week). I basically just ramble about math and the problems I find interesting and the lessons I learned from them.
6. Worked with friend on a visual novel about a girl who likes math but is intimidated by it - and learns to overcome her fear by joining math team and grows to love math. I did most of the writing while she did most of the drawing. (11th grade summer, 5hr/week).

I did not fill out any other activities. For MIT, I combined activity 1 and 2 since they only have 4 slots, and wrote about the remaining in my supplementals. I also never applied to or attended any competitive summer programs like PROMYS/SUMaC because I visited family in another country every summer.

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. USAJMO Qualifier (10th)
2. 4x AIME Qualifier (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)
3. Math Prize for Girls Qualifier (10th)
4. Miscellaneous awards from smaller math competitions (think competitions organized by students at universities, like Stanford and Berkeley).
5. Same as above
6. Scholarship for women in STEM ($5,000)

For MIT's non-scholastic awards, I put my volunteering awards (PVSA Gold) and writing awards (2x Scholastic Gold Key). I also put a yearbook superlative award I won but I unfortunately will not be disclosing it because people at my school will definitely know who I am.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

BC Calc Teacher - 8.5/10. My calc teacher is the advisor of my school's math team and the person initially encouraged me to join. He's definitely seen me grow a lot as a person and I know he wrote about how I went from being very shy and antisocial to proactively discussing problems with others and using math as a common language to bond with people.

AP Lang Teacher - 8/10. My English teacher really encouraged my creative writing and is a loyal reader of my blog. She made a comment about how my writing style is ""exactly like me"" and it's stuck with me ever since.

**Interviews**

MIT Interview - 7/10. My interviewer was trying to convince me to go into physics and we talked a lot about the intersection of math and physics. I made a cheesy analogy about how math and physics are like light and electromagnetism. He had to leave in a bit of a rush but it was overall a good interview.

Yale Interview - 6/10. I got interviewed really early so I thought that was a good sign. I was very relaxed going into the interview but my interviewer and I just didn't really click and the conversation didn't feel very natural. I think I was also trying too hard to seem interdisciplinary instead of talking about my genuine interests.

Harvard Interview - 8/10. I think this was actually my best interview! My interviewer studied Econ and I said I thought that was really cool because the stock market is a real-world example of geometric Brownian motion, which led to me explaining the Collatz conjecture and he looked really interested the whole time. I felt like we both genuinely learned from each other.

Princeton Interview - 7/10. My interviewer did such a good job of selling Princeton to me and by the end of it I felt like Princeton was an academic haven. We bonded over our love of historic campuses and knowing the history behind an institution and he told me so much about Princeton's rich past. The only reason I'm not rating this higher is because I didn't really talk about myself that much.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I loved my personal essay. Growing up in a hyper-academic family where both my parents are professors and researchers, I always felt respected, loved, valued; yet there was always something missing. We never had shouting matches or intense emotional arguments that every other family seemed to have.

Because of this, I began a habit of ""self-intellectualization"" and used my supposed intelligence as a shield growing up. Yet for all my supposed intellect, when my maternal grandmother passed away in my junior year and I saw my parents really succumb to emotion for the first time, I had no idea how to help or support them. I asked my mom for math help one day after school and it turned into a nightly ritual of my parents and I discussing problems in our research or schoolwork on the whiteboard. That brought us a lot closer as a family and healed our grief together, not just for my grandmother, but for years of emotional repression. My relationship with my parents has only gotten more warm and affectionate since then <3

**Additional Information:**

I was definitely a bit ambitious with my list applying to no safeties. I think what got me in is a mix of luck, having a very defined interest, and the lessons I've learned as a person in high school. I still have such a long way to go, but I'm excited for my future!

I am by no means extremely talented at math but I really love it and have dedicated a lot of time to it. I'm so grateful to my parents who have bought me every book I've ever needed and supported every one of my academic ambitions. 

MIT was my dream school for all of high school. I wore my MIT hoodie to every math competition for good luck, lol. But I ultimately chose Stanford because I think I have more potential to grow not just as an academic but as a person there. I genuinely never expected to get in to either of these schools but I'm so grateful that they saw something in me that I don't even see in myself yet. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me make my decision!

Reflections/Advice:

I was extremely lucky to get into my top choice after initially not receiving any aid; BU has given me the most money and is my ideal campus! Yes, of course I wished my stats were slightly better since I felt like I was slacking off in early years, but I am still very satisfied with my results!

1kd8exz,"Why I left my $10,000 college counselor for a Cornell student and got into 3 T10 Engineering Schools","**Disclaimer:** I don’t think you *need* a college counselor at all. But because my family could afford one, I thought I’d share my experience for anyone who’s curious or deciding where to spend their time and money.

**My Demographics**:

Gender: Male  
Race/Ethnicity: Indian  
Residence: India (9-10), California (11-12)  
Income Bracket: 500k+

(*Acceptances posted at the end!*)

Why I left my big college counseling service:

I started working with a pretty well-known college counseling company at the end of my freshman year. For international students, this company (not naming it because it could give me away) is fairly popular. My parents and I figured it was the “safe” choice.

It ended up being $250 per hour (nearly $10,000 over 2 years). There was an initial consultation with me and my parents, then a bunch of sessions to plan classes, ECs, and timelines for SAT/ACT testing.

They told me a lot of pretty general stuff, like “get involved in your school/community” and “build strong relationships with teachers.” They also gave me a “research project” to work on remotely with a professor in an area I said I was interested in. The “research project” was a lot of lit review rather than actual research, although I will say the person they matched me with knew a lot about what they were talking about.

They kept telling me my ECs I had were good and not to stress, but by around the end of sophomore year, after I had done some of my own research (shoutout tineo college prep) I worried that what I’d done wasn’t enough. At this point, I was president of a couple of clubs at my school (none of the clubs did anything too crazy), and I was still doing that “research” with that professor. 

Through a friend, I heard about a Cornell student who offered college counseling. After a conversation with my friend and an initial consultation with the new counselor, we decided to go with him even though he wasn’t the typical counselor I had in mind. His price was way more reasonable, especially considering how often we met (during junior year, like once a week) even though the sessions were short sometimes. It was also nice that I could text/call him at any time. 

He introduced me to the idea of a passion project and helped me create one centered around electric pushcarts for street vendors in my hometown in India. I truly loved this project, spending 10+ hours a week grinding with help from YouTube and my counselor. His help here was more so coming up with the idea and getting the project noticed (featured in my hometown paper), and less so anything technical. That project became the centerpiece of my app. He also helped me dive into hands-on research in LIDAR and food spoilage at my high school (I won $200 at my local science fair for my food spoilage research).

I can’t speak for how the big college services do essay editing from personal experience, but I’m fairly certain that the Cornell counselor was the better move for me. Some of my friends complained to me that their college counselors were “yes men” on their essays and didn’t help them improve their essays to the best they could be.

My counselor wasn’t afraid to tell me if my essays sucked, and also gave me a bunch of models/transformed essays that I thought were helpful. His input/ideas helped me write a personal statement that was unique and one I was super proud of (it was about Pokémon😭). Also, having someone you can just text at any time and who can drop in on your doc is super, super convenient. I still think my personal statement is what got me into some of these schools.

At the end of the day, the college app process is on you. No counselor can do the work for you, and no one’s gonna write all your essays or do your ECs. I’m making this post because I know some people who are getting scammed *right now*. If you’re gonna get a counselor, make sure they actually care about helping you. Learn from my mistake!

1kby7xu,"Only Rejected from one Ivy! (1450 SAT, 3.8+ GPA) Rural kids plz read last paragraph","Hey r/CollegeResults,

I’m eamack13, a white male from rural Vermont with a family income of around $50K, and I'm gonna share my full application profile. I applied both as a music/music technology major and to the College of Arts and Sciences (if the school had one, otherwise something similar), to all schools. Coming from a small-town public high school (where the average SAT is \~1050–1150 and only 5 AP classes are offered), I think I was able to carve out a unique profile. Here’s every detail (Self doxxing):

# 1. Demographics & Background

* **Gender:** Male
* **Race/Ethnicity:** White
* **Residence:** Rural Vermont
* **Family Income:** Approximately $50,000
* **School Type:** Rural Public High School (\~370 students)
* **Hooks:** Rural? Low represented state? Low income? I don't know

# 2. Academics

* **GPA & Class Rank:**
   * Unweighted GPA: 3.84 (around 3.95ish weighted)
   * Class Rank: 3/93 (rank not reported)
* **Course Load:**
   * Took all 5 AP classes offered by my school: AP Calculus AB, AP Biology (self-studied online), AP Physics 1, AP Psychology, and AP English Literature.
   * Advanced through math by starting with Algebra I in 9th grade, progressing through Geometry, Algebra II, and an online summer Precalculus course, finally doing AP Calc AB in senior year.
   * Also had a college level English writing class as a junior

# 3. Standardized Testing

* **SAT Superscore:** 1450  •
   * EBRW: 740  Math: 710  
   * I’ve always been a strong writer and a decent performer in essays, but I absolutely hate multiple-choice tests; studying for the SAT was the most miserable thing I've done in my life, so I didn't
* **AP Exams:**  •
   * AP Biology: 4
   * AP U.S. History: 3 (my greatest blunder)
* AP Calculus AB, AP Physics 1, AP Psychology, and AP English Literature: taking soon

Also took the ACT: 31 (not reported)

# 4. Extracurricular Activities

Music & Performing Arts

My musical journey is kind of the heart of my profile:

* **Ensemble Leadership & Performances:**  
   * **First Chair Euphonium:** Earned this position at multiple festivals including the Vermont All-State Music Festival, Northeast Instrumental Music Festival, District 5 Music Festival, (local college) Honors Festival, and High Notes Music Festival (some others too, but they were less important).

   * **Captain in Grades 11–12:** Led the team, organized warm-ups, and was recognized with a “Most Improved” award in 2022.

# 6. Letters of Recommendation

I haven’t read any of these (except band teacher), so they are just my estimates. 

* **History Teacher (APUSH):** Rated 7.5/10
   * Arguably one of only two vocal students in a 9-person class, but I didn't read this (I assume it was good, as my college results are good)
* **English Composition Teacher (Dual Enrollment):** Rated 7.5/10
   * Knows my personal journey well, from my unique metal forging projects to my extensive volunteer work, and provided a supportive, detailed recommendation.
* **Band Teacher:** Rated 6/10  
   * A solid, straightforward recommendation that confirms my musical contributions and leadership.
* **Guidance Counselor:** Rated 5/10
   * A newer relationship due to a counselor transition in my senior year, but she knew about my persistence with college affairs because I bugged her a lot...
* **Dartmouth Peer Recommendation:** Rated 8.5/10
   * Written by a friend who currently attends Dartmouth, this rec emphasized my personality, quirks, and integrity, also talked about when I visited and played with the marching band .
* **Past Church Recommendation:** Rated around 6–7/10
   * Authored by a long-time member of my church who has seen my growth and dedication through years of volunteering and community involvement.

# 7. Interviews

* **Yale:** Rated 8/10  
   * A very positive experience, probably improved by my personal connection (my brother goes to Yale), where we discussed my interests, background, and ambitions in a relaxed, engaging conversation, he lived near a place where I used to run cross country.
* **Dartmouth:** Rated 6/10  
   * Conducted by a hockey coach; the interview was solid but somewhat basic, focusing on common interests between Dartmouth and my small hometown.
* **UPenn:** Rated 4/10  
   * The conversation was underwhelming
* **Middlebury:** Rated 8/10  
   * A very enthusiastic interview that left me feeling confident.
* **University of Rochester:** Rated 3/10 (for me) / 7/10 (by the interviewer)
   * I mostly listened as the interviewer led the conversation, which didn’t allow me to fully showcase my personality, but he loved the school.
* **Brown:**  
   * Instead of a traditional interview, I submitted a video (the norm for Brown applications). I filmed it in a culvert after a fresh snowfall, walking along my hometown road while describing where I grew up.

# 8. Essays

* **Common App Main Essay:**
   * I wrote about building my own forge using clay from local marshlands, a process that involved navigating beaver dams and collecting a 40-pound bucket of pure clay. This essay (hopefully) symbolized my resilience, ingenuity, and ability to transform obstacles into personal triumphs. I consider it my best-written essay, full of detail and metaphors.
* **COVID Essay:**
   * Focused on how being homeschooled in 8th grade led to a math setback, and how I overcame this through self-driven online coursework, and had to juggle an online Precalculus class alongside AP Calculus during the first semester of my senior year. It underscored my perseverance and self-advocacy in the face of limited guidance.
* **Supplemental Essays:**  
   * Somewhat tailored for individual schools, but most of the schools (especially Cornell, Dartmouth, Yale, Northwestern, Brown, UPenn, University of Rochester, Amherst, and Boston University) all had semi-similar prompts, in which I either wrote about marching band, or my interests in an interdisciplinary study of music and technology, or community engagement.

# 9. College Admissions Results

   * Brown University
   * Dartmouth College
   * Middlebury
   * University of Michigan - Ann Arbor

Brown was initially around 25k as well, but Dartmouth was only 3k, and I used that offer to negotiate Brown to around 8500, which will be covered almost completely by various scholarships and grants I have been awarded independently. 

# Reflection?

I started high school without thinking much about college. My brother visited Cornell when I was in seventh grade, and I tagged along. I thought it looked cool and decided I wanted to go there someday. But as time passed (you know, COVID and everything), I started to feel like that goal wasn’t really for me. My brother was the Ivy League type, always focused and ahead of the curve. I wasn’t. I just did what I liked. I played music, volunteered, went to school, and didn’t think too hard about what came next.

It wasn’t until junior year, when I got first chair euphonium at the state concert band festival, that something clicked. I looked at everything I had done, almost by accident. I had close to 1000 hours of community service. I had decent grades in every core class. I was ranked high enough in my class. I started to think that maybe I could actually try.

Then I took the SAT (Spring 2024) and got a 1350. Cornell was cooked. Later I got a 1450, and we were so back. I spent December and January (a little in November) writing and rewriting essays every day (just for reference, I have about 37 pages of drafts for Cornell alone). In the end, I had around 45 pages of final drafts of college essays for the various 20 schools. I don’t know what possessed me to apply to 20 schools.

My Common App essay was about collecting a bucket of clay from a swamp behind my house to build a forge. It was about taking what I had and making something out of it. That idea is everywhere in my application (at least I think it is..). I live in a place with long winters and early sunsets, so I built something bright. I live in a town with almost no APs or clubs, so I studied what I could (music) and volunteered wherever possible. I did what was in front of me and tried to make it count.

Ivy Day was stressful. We had a senior vs staff basketball game going on at 7:00, but after I went to a corner store with my friends and got ice cream. We all circled around my phone as I opened results. UPenn was a no, which I expected. Brown was a yes. We got loud. Yelling and clapping and handshakes with the bros. Yale was a waitlist, fine (see edit). Dartmouth was a yes. More yelling. Cornell was a waitlist too. Two out of five Ivies. I had thought I might get none. On the drive home, I listened to Runaway by Kanye and leaked euphoric tears (rather unexpected, as I'm usually a chill guy, but dude it was a vibe)

Choosing between Dartmouth and Brown was hard. I live near Dartmouth and know people there, and I really like Hanover. But I picked Brown (see edit…). I like Providence, I like the academic flexibility, and I like that they don’t require a foreign language (I really hate foreign language studies). I don’t know exactly what I want to study alongside music, so the open curriculum made sense for me. Also, I love food, and Providence is good with restaurant diversity. Both schools are almost $0 for me after scholarships, which I am extraordinarily thankful for.

Looking back, I didn’t get into every top school (RIP Cornell). I didn’t get perfect test scores. I didn’t have some polished plan when I started high school. But I cared about what I was doing, even if it wasn’t flashy. I think that showed? If you’re reading this and you’re from a small school or a rural place, and it feels like you’re out of the loop, just know it’s not the end. You can do a lot with what’s around you. You can make something good out of almost anything. I think that’s what I tried to do. And I guess it worked?

Have hope, expect nothing, but be pleased with success.

thanks for reading :)

**Extracurriculars/Activities:** 

1. Varsity cross country/track and field - many of my awards were related to this. Massive time sink, wrote about it a lot. Qualified for state champs all years of participation, team captain for 3 seasons, and set school records for 200m and 400m that have definitely been broken since I started university

2. Robotics Club: Competed in FIRST Tech Challenge, never won shit but mentored middle schoolers in my school's LEGO League team, contributed to much of the code, and 3D printed toys for fundraisers

3. Red Cross Club - held officer role where I could just Photoshop shitty designs and see it plastered all over campus every time the club announced a blood drive

4. Work (paid) - held j\*b for half of high school, worked average of 35 hrs/wk during junior + senior year

5. Student ambassador for my high school - basically was a tour group guide and got volunteer hours to shill my high school

6. Repairing cars - college counselor said hobbies were fair game on the Common App, so I wrote about how my dad and I would flip cars to sell on Craigslist

7. Family responsibilities - both parents work, so my sisters have to be taken to practices and whatnot. Probably not something you'd put on the Common App but it was significant enough for me to talk about it

**Awards/Honors:** 

1. National Hispanic Recognition Award

2. National Merit Commended Scholar 

3. Distinguished Honor Roll for my school (top 5% GPA of student body?)

4. AP Scholar with Distinction

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** 

Common App essay: 8/10. Wrote an anecdote about how me burning the fuck out my carpet and almost starting a house fire was indicative of me being naturally curious. This was surprisingly a hit with almost all the schools I had applied to, and Harvey Mudd had actually wrote back to me in their acceptance letter ""Don't try and burn down the carpets here"" which they definitely do for all their acceptances, but it made my day.

Texas A&M prompts: 7/10, these are honestly not too bad and I don't wanna kill myself reading them

Harvey Mudd prompts: 8.5/10. Some of the more creative prompts I've had to write

Georgia Tech why us: 6/10. Holy fumble this shit is so cheesy

Purdue why us: 7/10, same amount of cheese yet better written which is funny because I finished this one the day before EA was due

Stanford prompts: 6/10, some of this is banger because I was able to talk about my hyperfixations but the one where they have you write about life experiences was probably the biggest example of fumbling the bag that I've seen in my life

I got no business being accepted to all these schools and going to the school I go to now, but I'm gonna make the most of it.

Econ Professor: Same thing had good terms with him, and I assume he did the same. 

**Essays**:

This wasn't too bad. as I actually had a lot of passion when writing about me, as well as the other supplemental essays. In my ""why"", I talked about what courses would fit my strength, and what I've learned/how I improved in college. In short, went into my feelings. What really helped me was using my university's writing center (basically tutoring for writing).

Throughout my whole high school, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a huge procrastinator, and it led me to an undesirable outcome.

Don't get me wrong, I had short streaks where I kinda give a fuck, but not in the long run.

I did a lot of copy and pasting between schools and would adjust as needed, so they were all pretty similar in style and structure. I tried to sell myself not just as a math grinder, but as an intellectual (which came through as noted by my Penn AO). I mostly focused on my other interests outside of math and told my story growing up in a restaurant, but I spent a lot of time on these trying to develop a narrative about my character.

**Additional Information**

Getting 0 rejections and a UC sweep was by far the most surprising thing. Wasn’t really expecting much applying as a math major without AMC or AIME. I thought my application was honestly fairly average as compared with some of the sweats on this subreddit and ended up really surprised with my results. 

Cost was not a significant factor, even though it did vary widely, but by the end, I was mostly between Brown and Penn. I chose Penn because I'm interested in working on Wall Street afterward and it had the stronger, built-up, and established Wall Street pipeline, but it was not an easy choice by any means. 

Looking back, I wish I'd applied to more schools (Yale, Stanford, Columbia for starters) and applied early to more places. I’m extremely happy and grateful for my results, but if I get off the Princeton waitlist, I’m going there. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kb4l3q/default_asian_guy_beats_system_w_0_rejections_and/,1745976327,1530,,3.879608068,Asian,"University of Oregon (EA + $20k/yr Excellence Scholarship), Purdue (EA + $10k/yr Presidential Scholarship), USC (EA), UMich (EA), UMD (EA + $15k/yr President’s Scholarship), UC Berkeley (Early admit for Regents - did not get), UCSB (Chancellor’s Early Invite), UC Davis (RD + $7.5k Fulmor Scholarship), UW (RD + $5.4k Purple and Gold Scholarship), UCSD (RD w/ Regents), UC Irvine (RD + $6k/yr Chancellor’s Scholarship), Harvey Mudd (RD), Williams (RD), UCLA (RD w/ Regents), Brown (RD), UPenn (RD + committed!)","UChicago (RD), Amherst (RD), Pomona (RD), Northwestern (RD), Dartmouth (RD), Princeton (RD)","* Residence, * Type of School, * GPA (UW/W), * \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc., 4.

# Letters of Recommendation

APES Teacher - 8/10 - Did really well in her class and was one of the more engaged students in the room. Environmental science is pretty easy so I usually ended up helping my classmates which she noticed. I actually really enjoyed her class and had some good talks with her about my future plans and personal life, which is kinda weird because I didn't know she existed before I took the class. She said I reminded her of her son but idk if that's a good thing or not. Super sweet and super nice lady. Ultimately this is the only AP test I didn't get a 5 on which is lowk my fault because I got waaay too cocky after breezing through all the practice tests in the weeks before. Didn't study at all so I deserve it.

  
Calculus Teacher - 9/10 - Known her since freshman year because of math team and did well in her class. She's very fair and probably the best math teacher I've ever had. She even met my parents at one point so I'm hoping she wrote a nice letter. Talked a bunch about college options and different paths I could take in life with her. She gave me some good advice about taking care of myself mentally and avoiding burnout which I really struggle with. She emphasized the importance of healthy coping mechanisms and how she's seen too many students with bright futures ruin it for themselves through self-destructive tendencies \*cough\*cough\*. I trust her a lot and I'm sure she wrote a solid letter.

# Interviews

Duke (7/10) - Zoom call soon after I submitted my application. Talked a little bit about the academics but ended up chatting more about college life in general and Durham. She gave a lot of great advice that would be really useful if I was going there, especially about which dorms to pick, professors to avoid, and things to do. Was lowk coming off a brazy weekend during the interview so I wasn't my usual charming self. 

John Carroll (10/10) - Met this guy in-person at a Panera. He bought me food and coffee when I was having a shitty day so instant 10/10. Had a 1.5 hour long conversation about pretty much every part of the school and I filled three pages of notes up. Dude was super welcoming, communicative, easy-to-work-with, and friendly. It's unfortunate that this school was pretty much my last resort because this dude was putting in the EFFORT to get me to go there. Was also getting recruited to wrestle here pretty hard.

UChicago (3/10) - Recruiting call over the phone. Dude was trying really hard to convince me to go but pretty much deflected all of my questions and kept circling back to ""notthealt42, UChicago is an amazing investment into your future"" like a bajillion times. This was soon after he dropped the $95k annual COA and mentioned that they don't give athletic scholarships or really much merit aid at all. He just didn't have any actual information about the school and it felt like he was just talking to me to try to convince me to commit. Ended up not applying.

Loyola Chicago (9/10) - In-person interview for scholarship. Only lasted about 20 mins. I was one of the last people interviewed that day and my lady was losing her voice. Talked a lot about my car, legal troubles in relation to said car, the beauty of mac n cheese, and the detrimental effects of healthcare inequality on communities and individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, especially in relation to the societal poverty cycle and the unfair burden of medical debt upon families and how going to Loyola for premed will help support my goal of working towards solving that issue. I would give it a 10 but I was lowk sick af leading up to the interview and was so zonked off the flu meds that I don't remember the finer details. Must've done well though because I got a phone call a month later where they told me my interviewer thought I was ""the most human"" candidate.

# Essays

Personal statement I put a fuck ton of time into. I started writing it at the end of junior year and didn't really finish until October, two weeks before my first applications went out. I did this on purpose. I worked on it bit by bit everyday until it was almost perfect so that I wouldn't procrastinate it until the last minute. and I got as many eyes on it as I could. I'm actually really proud of it even though I clocked in at 647 words which is slightly high. I wrote the essay about pizza. The main selling point of my pizza place is that customers are able to completely customize their pizza, from type of crust to the toppings to how it's cut. I wrote the essay about how every pizza I made was a ""floury caricature"" of the individuals on the other side of the glass and that every topping and culinary-decision represented memories, personality traits, cultural backgrounds, childhood experiences, etc. I then described my personal pizza and the various parts of my life story and personality represented through every ingredient. 

Supplemental essays I honestly wish I spent more time on. I got REALLY burnt out really fast, and was under a shit ton of pressure from my parents to get a big scholarship so I (and my family) didn't have to deal with expensive college costs. August-January was also really hard for me in my personal life. I had a lot of really stressful things I was dealing with that made it damn hard to focus on the seemingly distant future. Some of this was caused by my own irresponsible decisions but a lot of it was just fucking unlucky. As a result, some of my supplementals were a little lacking. They weren't bad but they were just kind of basic, especially my ""Why Us"" essays where I didn't include nearly enough detail.

# The Decision

My wrestling career came to a close when one of my internal organs decided to implode during a match. Goes to show how relying on athletics to get you into and pay for college can be a risk... anything can change with just a little bit of bad luck.

So, it comes down to three schools: Northwestern, Tulane, and Loyola Chicago. 

Northwestern - $220k est. total, w/ ISP more like $170k. Dream school since I was 10 mostly because of my parents. My mom went there for undergrad/grad. Spent my whole childhood around Northwestern events and people, especially ISP alumn so I **really** wanted to do it.

Tulane - $125k est. total, really fell in love with this school especially after admitted student day

LUC - $78k est. total, full-tuition scholarship. Don't like the school personally and academically weakest school of the three. But I only have to pay room and board which parents are willing to help me out with so its basically **free**.

I have two days left to make a decision. After many sleepless nights fueled by stress and depression (hence why I'm up at 3am (now 4am)) and long talks with my family I don't think I can turn Loyola down. **I have a very real possibility of graduating undergrad completely debt free.** This is an insane blessing and I am so incredibly thankful to have been offered this opportunity. I have multiple younger siblings going to college right after me and my parents can't cosign loans for all of us. Yes, I'm sacrificing my dreams, but sometimes that's just how shit goes. At the end of the day undergrad is a stepping stone to medical school. I'm not here for the ""traditional college experience"" where these are the ""best four years of my life"": I'm here to get in, get out, and ball tf out on that transcript and the MCAT.

**Additional Information:**

In total I applied to 20 schools and got 14 acceptances, 2 waitlists, and 4 rejections, coming out to a 70% acceptance rate. By my classifications 7 of those were reach schools or hard targets, 4 were targets, and 9 were safeties or light targets. I also applied for every available honors program and got into all of em. I also applied for **every** additional merit-scholarship I could. Between the personal statement, supplementals, scholarships, honors programs, and specialty programs... I wrote well over 60 essays!

I did NOT ED anywhere because I can't make that financial commitment haha

Speaking of finances:

The mean 4-year cost of all 14 schools I got into came out at $171,091.46 with a minimum of $77,800 (LUC) and a maximum of $297,552.00 (USC). It is worth noting that UW-Madison gave me $0.00 in total aid totalling to $259,312.00 after four years which is STILL cheaper than USC who gave me $25.5k per year in merit. Adding up all my annual aid packages over four years as they are today, I earned a total of **$1,412,496** in merit scholarships.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Math Team Coach and Former Teacher: 10/10, Had a very strong bond with him, was one of the only adults I trusted to come out to, have worked with him since 5th grade, served as one of his assistant's from 9th grade onwards. Still keep in touch with him until this day.

Research Professor: 8/10, I think he wrote a decent letter, he liked my work, but I did not get to finish it because he left for another university.

Coaching Boss: 9/10, He was the one who took a chance on me and allowed me to be a competitive coach after being allowed by him to volunteer for a year in the competitive program. Told me that he liked my work ethic and my promotion to being a paid coach was well deserved. Seemed disappointed that I wasn't staying in NC.

Highschool History Teacher: 7/10, Did well in his class and talked to him all throughout high school.

Physics Teacher: 6.5/10, Probably wrote a standard letter of rec, nothing special.

**Interviews**

I came into my two interviews very unprepared (MIT and NU). They both went poorly but it seems to not have made a large impact on decisions.

**Essays**

My common app essay focused on how coaching saved my soul, changed how I viewed the world, and how I want to use it as an outlet to help the children I coach improve as people first, then as players. It was good writing but I felt that it could have been more efficient in its delivery. I would classify it as personal growth.

I think my supplemental essays for Northwestern were my best writing through the application process. I think they summed me up very well in just a few hundred words.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Math director at school: 10/10 the way she wrote about me, you would've thought I was the second coming of Christ with the brain of Einstein. I was in 2 clubs with her as the lead, and she taught me for 3 years. She also let me teach lessons while she was away 😭😭.

Religious Studies teacher: 6/10, honestly kinda mid. I only knew her through one class and one club, so she didn't really have much to write about.

Counsellor Rec: 8/10. Had her as a teacher for a year, and she low-key hated me for no reason 😭. I think our relationship has improved significantly since then, and she is very familiar with my extracurricular activities, so probably not too bad.

**Interviews**

Waterloo: 10/10. ABOLUTELY COOKED ON THIS ONE

Harvard: 6/10. Thought it was great at the moment, but looking back, it was very unoriginal

Columbia: 8/10. Written a lot better,, but nothing exceptional.

Yale: 9/10. Spent ALOT of time writing (and overthinking) these ones, and they turned out pretty great

UIUC: 8/10. Pretty standard, but well written.

UT Austin: 8/10. Also pretty standard, but well written

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** 

**Essays:**  
Questbridge specific essays were not so great. They were really barebones, but looking back thats probably what made them so strong. I talked about my past and how dysfunctional my family was leading to depression up until late quarantine where i gave my life to Christ... yes I talked about my faith and how that transformed my life... (8/10)

**Stanford** essays were mid at best, nothing to distinguishable and my roommate essay was weak and looking back felt really copy and paste. (6.5/10)

**Yale** essays were alright, it was very short with 2 100-200 word prompts and I feel like I messed up on one because I didn't really answer the question, at least looking back. I just cut around the corners probably from overthinking as I only had 2 weeks for all my supplementals because questbridge is weird and thinks 2 weeks is enough. (6/10)

**JHU** no supplemental essays

**Duke** essays were my best work and honestly looking back really went through who I was and some key experiences in my life that led to some of the activities I do now (anti-bullying club). I think what struck them the most was how I connected one of their supplementals to my personal statement and through it was able to shed some more light into a gap my personal statement had (I noticed this when looking back). I think showing that interconnection definitely made me a better candidate... showed nuance in who I was and that is good. (9.5/10)

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

* *Acceptances:* (list here): Duke! (A.B. Scholar ---> Full Ride + 5k Research Stipend)
* *Rejections:* Stanford, Yale, JHU

I know Stanford, Yale, and JHU rejected me because I ranked them all above Duke (with Duke being my last choice)

Questbridge is binding, so I'm committed to Duke

**Additional Information:**

Honestly, questbridge was a really weird process, but it really allowed me to showcase my story. Surprisingly, I wrote my Duke essays in the **last 9 hours** before they were due... because I thought that I wanted to go to the other schools more. Crazy... I know. They even had some grammar errors...  
Then SOMEHOW, I got the A.B. Scholar designation which apparently is their flagship merit scholarship and only \~10 out of the 55,000 who apply to Duke get it every year.  
Pretty happy with those 9 hours which basically gave me a scholarship valued at \~400k.  
Also technically the second full ride as questbridge is also considered a full-ride (although it is for financial circumstances more than merit imo)

My essay was about how I saw STEM in art and art in STEM idk I think my execution was good for something kinda simple.

LORs: The people I asked to do my LORs with I had good connections with. Swim coach who is also my manager was probably like a 8/10. LOR with my physics teacher (sorry for getting a 3 :( ) was likely really good and my LOR with my history teacher (had her for 2 years total, awesome lady) was likely really good too.

Interviews: Only had one interview with Bowdoin. I liked it! But I was worried a lot of what I was saying was shallow. The guy I talked to was pretty funny too I thought it was great and I'm happy I decided to do it.

The SUPER surprising part was that I had SO SO SOOOO many connections and legacy with Bowdoin (people im related to there, people on the board or something, etc.). I was deferred in ED and denied in RD. But overall, I am super super happy with how this went!! I hope anybody reading this doesn't tweak out about not being competitive enough. Trust me, the writing and the LORs were definitely my carry for my lack of ""astounding"" ECs. I have never once qualified for state in swimming (and tbh I hardly even go) or done anything to be at the D3 level or anything like that.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

calc bc/calc 3 teacher: I can't give a rating because I have never read a letter from my calc teacher but in terms of our relationship I was top of his class for bc and would come in regularly after school to talk more in depth about the topics he taught during class because I was interested in calculus. I also helped tutor for him before tests as well.

ap csp/csa teacher: can't give a rating as well cause I have never read anything by him but this relationship was more casual because we didn't have to learn as much in his classes so sometimes my class would just watch random youtube videos or play videogames. Me and him share similar interests in videogames so we would talk about that. I also still worked hard in his class and also came in sometimes for help or further discussion on some topics.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

n/a

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

quality was probably buns, I was so overwhelmed with school and stressed about college because of reading other people's decisions on here that I wasn't even starting my applications until like December 31st so I wrote my common app in a day and did a college a day. What didn't help was that I wasn't using net price calculators because if I did I could've seen how much the schools wouldn've cost.

1k9gksa,Im scared of rubber chickens but not the waitlist ( + HYPSM and top CS School admits WHATTT???),"Hi everyone! First of all if you know me, no you don't :)  
  
So I'd like to preface this with that my decisions were almost entirely lucky (imo). I've met some people already who have published multiple research papers, developed AI algorithms, are nationally recognized in their instrument, or have founded non-profits that are already changing the world. I seriously wish that I could have done more during high school though, like I feel so completely behind everyone else. Definitely lucky, but I'll take it and I'm so grateful for my results, I cannot wait for the next four!

**Letters of Recommendation**

*Note: I haven't seen any of these so I'm guessing mostly! I wish I had more opportunities to connect with my teachers more deeply, as they were all genuinely so amazing!!!*

Counselor - 5/10: I didn't talk too much with him but he knew about me? Super nice guy though!!!

AP Physics Teacher - 7 or 8 /10: I have him for another class this year too which helps I guess! He seemed happy to write a letter for me and I know he spent about 3 weeks on it too! I'd have some conversations and such with him but I'm not sure if I ever fully connected with him (though I would have liked to, he's an amazing teacher and person!)

AP US History Teacher - 7 or 8 /10: I used to draw pictures on his whiteboard at the start of every class with his name in some cheesy pun. I think he liked it! I genuinely enjoyed his class and teaching and he seemed happy to write a letter for me! 

**Interviews**

Dartmouth - 6/10: My first interview, so I was nervous and kind of jumped through my answers or over-yapped. I learned a lot about the school though, and my interviewer was very sweet! I think I connected with her, but yeah could have definitely been more prepared, especially for an in-person interview. Went about an hour.

Princeton - 5/10: This one was virtual, and went alright I guess! We talked a lot about my 3D modeling but I don't think I fully connected with her. I asked some questions and such but I probably could have done better. Still got to learn a lot about Princeton and it was definitely educational. Went about 45 minutes.

Yale - 9/10: My interviewer and I connected very well I think! He was a graduate student so there was a bit of difference in experience but we bonded over music and food. He asked a lot about my personal life and shared some of his favorite stories when I asked! This one was in person, and lasted a bit over an hour. Definitely felt more prepared for this one. My only mistake was I kept calling him Mr. when he was an MD so I fixed it in my future emails (I hope I wasn't being too stupid :( )

Penn - 3/10: Nice guy, but also definitely didn't connect with him. He asked a couple questions, and I asked a couple. Was really short and I definitely didn't feel prepared for it. I think these aren't evaluated though! This one was online and went about half an hour.

Duke - 4/10: She mainly had me ask her questions or tell her about myself, so I didn't have too much guidance. She told me a bit about camping before basketball games and such which seemed like fun! Didn't fully connect to her though, and she said like only one person she's interviewed got in so I got scared a bit. This one was online and about half an hour.

Harvard - 8/10: Besides accidentally walking into the back of the office into a restricted area instead of the front entrance, it went really well! We talked about restaurants, our shared interest in physics, ideal pasta shapes, 3D modeling, and more! She graduated a long time ago so there was a bit of a gap but that's okay! Was in-person and went about an hour.



**Essays**

Personal Statement - 6/10: Originally wrote for Questbridge but wasn't a finalist. Revised it a bit and used it for my main personal statement! It was about how my sister scared me with a rubber chicken all the time, but how when she was hospitalized and I lived on my own for months, I started to miss it. I linked it to my understanding of autonomy and adulthood and that independence does not equal maturity. I didn't talk about a big difference I made though, and it was NOT written eloquently at all. It told more than it showed, and it sounded more like a personal commentary then a beautiful and visceral essay. I spent a few weeks over the course of a couple months on it! 

* (Wrote another personal statement on my costco trips with my grandfather and learning from all the employees but scrapped it after I saw that a costco essay had gotten famous in the past... used the general idea for my Rice and Princeton essays though!) 

Supplements - 8/10: I worked a lot on these. Wrote about my interest in spatial rhetoric, the intersection between music and physics and how everything has rhythm, my work with bassoon reeds, my want to help with quality of life with those with vestibular dysfunction with biomedical engineering, disagreements in band, my eagle scout project, and my affinity for getting stuck in nets (definitely my favorite one). These were definitely more eloquently written!

**Additional Information:**

I was stuck between CMU SCS and Yale for a while but after visiting I fell in love with Yale, so I will likely be committing there! I am so excited to meet everyone on campus and spend these next four years with changemakers, researchers, and artists. At Bulldog Days, I met such an amazing group of people (but over half are committing elsewhere :((( ), but I am so excited! It all works out :) 

I honestly did not (and still a lot of times don't ) think I'm T20 caliber. Like I mentioned before, the people I've met are the smartest, most accomplished people I've ever seen. Speaking at the UN, coke scholars, working with congress, developing AI algorithms (which I've always wanted to try!) winning national science fairs, and so much more, there are so many times where I feel like I am definitely not nearly where everyone else is, or didn't take advantage of my time. 

During high school, I've always wanted to get involved in starting a nonprofit or doing research but I never knew where to start. And, coming from a rural public high school with a huge emphasis on sports and technical education, I never really had much guidance or many opportunities made available or known. I could have definitely made my own though, and I feel that I definitely fell behind. I really hop to catch up in college because I want to become a changemaker and help those around me. Idk if it's imposter syndrome or if I really did just get lucky, but some of the other kids I've met are leagues beyond what I could have ever imagined was possible in high school. I really do wish I did more, whether that was research, AI development, or public policy initiatives, but I hope I'll have those opportunities in college! 

Either way, I am so thankful for all of the help I've received, for my decisions, and for the opportunities I have been offered, and I cannot wait for the next four :)

CS Teacher I TA'd 2 years for. I really tryharded his classes and was his TA so he definitely had a lot to write about me. (9/10)

APUSH Teacher. We were like neutral, I was occasionally locked in for his class and was not a net negative in classroom. We were friendly but not like that close. (6/10)

Professor I did research under, really good rec letter but I'm not sure how much emphasis colleges would give it. (8/10)

**Interviews**

Stanford: Pain (3/10)

MIT: Pain, but fun conversation (6/10)

Princeton: Gave everyone I knew an interview except me (-100/10)

**Essays**

Chat I don't know about you, but maybe, maybe, JUST MAYBE, my common app wasn't the greatest. Personally I liked my Common App story, but ig the rest of the world didn't. I also think my supplementals probably weren't the most creative or innovative, but I thought they brought across my experiences and passions nicely. 

I personally definitely thought my UC App was better than my Common App. With the extra space in the ECs section and 4 big essays, I was definitely able to dive into my ECs and passions much better. 

I would personally give my Common App a 8/10 and my UC App a 9/10.

**Reflection:**

Yea this process is so cooked. Everything is so arbitrary and random, particularly this year. I have friends who absolutely cooked, and I also have friends who got absolutely cooked. I have friends who got saved by luck, and friends who got exactly what they were predicting. In the end, truly no one understands the process, no one can accurate predict what is going to happen or where you will end up. 

Now, I would give you the advice I wish I had before starting this process, saying you should quit scrolling this subreddit, start working on your apps earlier, stop stressing over college, and to start enjoying your life. But let's be real, I know you aren't going to listen, because I didn't listen. I don't understand college admissions anymore than 1 year ago, and I don't even really understand life anymore than 1 year ago.

I'm 100% committing to Syracuse University if they give me good FA! UVA has always been my top choice, and will accept if I get accepted of the waitlist, also Syracuse and very expensive and have to apply to lots of scholarships, but I'm honestly surprised with some of my results.

A lot of the deferrals I received were very unexpected considering my grades and other stats, along with being waitlisted by UVA. My biggest take away is SAT, Grades, Rank, all of those things really don't matter, as long as your EC's are good and your essays tell a story.

Additional information:

If you're an Indian international, male, need aid, want to major in STEM and are from a non feeder school, please understand the hyper competitive nature of admissions. You constantly see Indian males saying they got rejected everywhere or they didn't get any affordable offers, it's usually because of certain weaknesses in their applications.



1. You **need 97+ in 9th and 10th,** **90+ in 11th** and **90+ in 12th midterms** with a **95+ predicted in 12th.** Yes, it is very difficult to maintain such high grades, especially with grade deflation in 11th and 12th mid-terms, but these are the best colleges on the planet—they want the best possible students. That is a very harsh reality.



2. No matter your major, intellectual interests or favorite subjects, if you want to get into top schools with aid and you're doing CBSE or ISC in 11th and 12th, you **need PCM + CS/Econ/Biology/Psychology/Biotechnology/Any other academic subject.** Unless you have something very rare or special, having PCM + Physical Education or Informatics Practices or Fine arts or Music will kick you out of the running, because top colleges that give aid **highly value** course rigor, and being seen with easier subjects like P.Ed, IP and Fine Arts will make it clear that you wanted easy subjects to focus on PCM. That is exactly **not** the kind of student these top schools want.
If you have the Commerce or Humanities, **make sure to have Standard Mathematics in 11th and 12th,** otherwise you'll be seen to have low rigor and will be kicked out of the running academically. Also, CBSE **Applied Mathematics** is absolute BS. 


3. High SAT scores. Cannot stress this enough. If you're in dire need of aid, a 1550+ is an absolute must, especially if you're an Indian male in STEM. An 800 in Math is basically expected of you, and 750+ in EBRW is necessary to prove you are at the reading comprehension level that a rigorous liberal arts education will demand.


4. AP Exams. Though not strictly necessary, but if you are like I was and had PCMB (Pure Science Stream) and wanted to major in non-STEM, having AP scores in subjects that demonstrate your academic interest in your intended major is very, very helpful. Almost all successful aid seekers who got into top schools like WASP LACs and Ivies **will have scores of 4 or 5 on multiple AP tests.** I definitely think part of the reason I got into Amherst was that inspite of me having only Sciences in my curriculum, I demonstrated proficiency in Humanities subjects via my AP tests. 


5. English Proficiency testing. I definitely do not recommend asking the colleges to waive English Proficiency tests by saying your school is English medium or having a high SAT EBRW sub-score. Yes the TOEFL and IELTS cost money, but please do take them. 

The rule for the **TOEFL is having no less than 27 on each section**, and for **IELTS, no less than 8 on each section.**



All the Indians I see getting rejected everywhere don't have one or more of the above **unspoken requirements.**


It's actually not that hard to get into top schools with aid from India if you meet all of these benchmarks, because so few of the applicants from India meet them, especially the ones from non-feeders.


ECs have to be strong, but they are far more subjective in nature, and have to be related to what you want to do in college and you need to be passionate about them, because that is the only way you'll reflect well on them in essays.


I was a Gov/Econ major, not STEM, but I had extremely strong STEM academics and testing, so I demonstrated proficiency in all aspects of a liberal arts curriculum, which is why I believe I was a successful applicant.

I wish the best to all of you! I hope you all achieve your goals.



**Note from me personally:** Ik my friend has a somewhat exclusionary, cynical, perfectionist and somewhat elitist worldview of how admissions work for applicants from India, but having seen recent admissions cycles, I'm unfortunately inclined to believe he's somewhat right 😭. I had so much less compared to him, and I was FAR from a perfect applicant, but I still got into Harvard.

Reflections: I’m super glad that I got off the waitlist for UCLA. Before that I was just content with going to UCSD but now I’m heading to the number 1 public school in the nation. Truly mind boggling. Thank you A2C and this subreddit for providing the guidance I never had for the college application journey. This is proof that everything happens for a reason and your timeline is different than everyone else’s. I crashed out on Ivy day, thinking I had wasted my time and effort for nothing only to get into UCLA a month later. Waitlists are not a no, have hope!

1k6pm1f,a real throwback: HYP in 2011 and 2013,"Have seen a bunch of posts from here show up in my feed and thought it would be fun to share my brother and my results from over a decade ago. For some context, by the early 2010s, the admissions industrial complex was already in full swing. Instead of reddit, eager high school students flocked to college confidential. The paid test prep and essay coaching arms race was on, and we would talk about how much easier admissions had been 10 years prior. While a lot has changed, I think this 2010ish period still has much more in common with the present than the 1990s or 2000s does.

For brevity, I'll merge the two profiles. Where something differs for one of us I'll flag it with a (B) for brother or (M) for myself.

**Demographics**

White, male, did not apply for financial aid. Public HS in the mountain west. Not legacy but arguably geography hook.

AP/IB: 5-7 5s (B), 9 5s, 1 4, (M)

Class Rank: 3/~350 (B), ~7/350 (M)

Post-AP coursework: Calc III, linear algebra, diff eq at local university (M). SSP astro junior summer (M).

Intended major: Philosophy (B), Physics (M)

**ECs**

Varsity sport (not good enough to get recruited)

State champion speech and debate (B)

Criminal justice volunteering/leadership (B)

Gigging band with friends (M)

Job coaching kids in sport jr/sr year (M)

Science research with professor at local university (M)

**Interview (3 for different schools):**
Penn: alumni, I don’t think this one contributed that much. I was super nervous but we talked about books for a bit and asked about what my plans were for the future. another was with an advisor and she was so nice she told me outright that it didn’t contribute to my application.

Georgetown: alumni, I also don’t think it contributed much, the guy I had was also pretty chill and he just said that this interview is to make sure you’re not like a psychopath or something

Pitt: this was for a full-ride scholarship and I was lowkey really unprepared but somehow made it past this phase. it was like a zoom call with 4 people

Penn healthcare ineqity: Talked about how a personal incident of inequity has driven me to research (Penn Nursing is a huge nursing research Hub) and how i wanted to work with namedropped professors 

Penn community: “A community often flourishes with shared interest and agreement. Innovation occurs when people feel safe to experiment, and find healthy competition. Penn cultivates these important aspects of community: a peaceful haven living with like-minded students, and the advantages of the fast-moving city of Philadelphia, a networking central with promising opportunities” 
basically sums it up and I also namedroped cubs and specific things I liked about the nursing program

Penn Thank you: to my sister who basically raised me 

Okay so I started my application to a lot of presegious schools but once I had to get supplementals I kinda dropped them I think this is an important step to really narrow down what schools you ACTUALLY want to go to, (villanova is incomplete for example)

**A NOTE ON ESSAYS:** When I went to meet with Penn’s advisor, she told me that my essays really stood out in my application. THEY MATTER so don’t write some junk essays. My friend found an editor on Reddit who has experiece editing essays for big schools, she has a company now called Type A Essays on LinkedIn. Her Reddit is @/mauisusan111 and she is also started a youtube channel for writing advice. She was genuinely so helpful I had her edit all my essays for Penn. My biggest struggle was the word limit and she definietly helped me use more concise/effective language! I highly recommend!!

**A NOTE ON PENN:** I was accepted and went to visit/talk to adivsors about financial appeals. The Nursing school is VERY selective: I spoke with someone who told me 2% of ED applicants were accepted (dm for actual numbers of ED acceptence vs RD acceptance I don’t want to get in trouble), these stats were from a year ago so idk how accurate they still are ik that most nursing schools are expanding. 

**Decisions:**
ACCEPTED:
- Penn ED!! (turned down for financial reasons)
- Pitt RD (+ semifinalist for full-ride scholarship)
- Duquesne EA
- Hofstra EA
- DeSales EA
- University of Scranton EA
- Drexel EA

DNF/WITHDREW (bailed with the supplementals): 
- Georgetown 
- Villanova
- University of Michigan
- University of Washington

DEFERRED:
- Northeastern (EA defferal and I withdrew my application after)

also my best friend was valedictorian of the school and she had pretty similar stats and extra curriculars and she got in ED to Cornell for Biology/Neuroscience 

I am currently a Pitt Nursing student, and I really love it here tbh. I know that most of you guys won’t believe me that ivy leagues aren’t really all that (because I was just like you). But honestly, the Pitt program is #4 in the nation with great teachers/social scene for half the price, and I’ll take that every day

**Additional Information:**

Advice: If you have the opportunity to do so try to make your story flow through your ECs and try to be good in a very niche area - while I'm not an admissions officer I definitely think that being so successful in a sector of engineering that's not commonly applied as really helped me through this process. Last thing - the earlier you start the better! While it looks I applied to way too many schools(I probably did), I started in the summer with my personal statement and tried to write supplements every other week instead of overcramming in winter break.

* **Demographics:** Male
* **Residence:** US citizen from Shimla, India
* **Income Bracket:** $50K (Applied for aid everywhere)
* **Type of School:** Private, Non-feeder but incredibly cut-throat and strict
* **Hooks:** Maybe FGLI? I doubt AO's cared though.

**Intended major:** Global Affairs, International Relations, and Political Science wherever possible.



**Academics:**

* **CBSE:** 91 (9th), 92.2 (10th), 84 (11th), 95.8 (12th)
* **Courseload in 11th and 12th:** Economics, Psychology, History, Political Science and English (no Math, pretty big red flag for the first app cycle)

**Standardized testing:**

* **SAT:** 1560 (770R, 790M) (Present Equivalent, 2320 with a 760 in writing)
* **APs:** AP Calc AB (4), AP Gov (5), AP Micro (4)



**Extracurricular Activities:**

I had a spike, but the details are pretty typical of what you'd expect of these ECs. 

1. Founder and Head of Model UN Club, took up nearly all of my time in school (outside of class of course)

2. Co-founder of International Relations and Global Affairs Club, and pivoted activities towards social outreach and education about global politics in my school, which was until then, non existent in the curriculum.

3. Economics Research, basically just financial mathematics, statistical analysis and researching the global economy.

4. Sociology Research, where I did a comparative study on interactions between religions, communal violence and it's larger interplay in international policy in both India and the US.

5. Global Affairs research, where I basically studied the US's policies about overseas taxation and bigger army diplomacy.

6. History Research, mainly a comparative study of Imperial Britain, Colonial India, and slavery in the US during the Victorian era, and ideas of liberty in each.

7. Writing. Just something I adored. 60+ short poems and short stories, and published this as a book during my gap year (literally just 7 people bought it though lol)

8. Piano. 

9. Gardening! I grew nearly a 100 species of plants in my lifetime and adore my plants! I really plan on getting rich in BigLaw and buy a house where I can have a small greenhouse lol (I actually said that in my Harvard interview lol)

10. Volunteering at a local temple and the surrounding ashram in the mountains. Took up my weekends, but was really fulfilling and I talked about it in my personal statement.



**Awards/Honors:**
Nothing really significant at all, I just put several school debate and MUN chair awards on here (nothing significant lol), AP Scholar and another pretty insignificant cash prize thing.


**Letters of Recommendation:**

* **Psychology (10/10):** Really spoke to my engagements in Psychology research both inside and outside the classroom, and was a real support for me during my mental health struggles.
* **Economics (10/10):** Spoke to my quantitative and calculative abilities in Macroeconomics and Econometrics (this was an extremely important part of the letter because it helped address my Math gap properly.
* **Counselor (10/10):** Loved this letter, spoke to my involvement with the debate, MUNs and my passion about Global Affairs.
* **Research mentor (10/10):** She really helped me understand a lot of topics in IR and was the person who inspired me to apply for Global Affairs instead of Economics.


**Essays:**

My main essay was about my growth as an American citizen who came to India, and how I discovered my identity as a result (generic I know, but very uniquely written, trust me). 

Supps were also pretty unique and included both my intellectual and artsy sides. Some of the LACs were absolute HELL to write cuz they're so short. But in general, most of my supps elaborated on my love for history and global politics.



**Interviews:**
 
**Macalester (sign-up):** 10/10, cute little conversation about Mac and it's offerings.

**Georgetown:** Honestly pretty meh, but the lady also majored in Global Affairs and was pretty honest—probably the person who helped me realize that Georgetown wasn't the place for me.

**Princeton:** 6/10, pretty bad as there was a storm and the call kept dropping, but also a great conversation.

**Harvard:** 10/10, the man was totally not who I was expecting to be a Harvard alumnus. In a T-shirt and shorts, whereas here I was in a suit lol. Ultimately, it was a really deep conversation about self exploration, growth and understanding which lasted about 2.5 hours. Probably one of the deepest conversations I've had in my life.

Additional information:


The first time I applied during senior year of high school, I was ill-informed, lazy, did not do my research, and wrote pretty lousy essays. I had no AP tests to report, my SAT was the present equivalent of a 1460 (720R, 740M), and my academics were definitely sub-par for the very top schools, but somehow, Oberlin College accepted me to their Class of 2020 with an EFC of 9K. I was extremely grateful for it and I looked forward to matriculating, but somehow due to certain life events, I ended up taking a gap year.


I understood the weaknesses that held me back in the first cycle I applied as I went along. More than my 10th board results (which basically have to be 95+ if you want ivies), my subjects in 11th and 12th were a really big problem because I did not have Mathematics. That's why nearly every place I applied to rejected me, except 2 waitlists (Hamilton and Macalester) and 1 acceptance (Oberlin).

The next cycle, I signed up for three AP exams, including 1 AP Calc which was the only way to demonstrate Math proficiency given my two year Math gap. That, and to score as high as possible on the SAT Math section. Given that I got a 4 and a 790, while not perfect, it demonstrated proficiency which was the most important thing.

I reworked and refined my ECs, re-did my common app essay, and rewrote all my supp's. I was very strategic and applied to privates and only privates, and a shit ton of LACs because they were more likely to accept me (given what Oberlin did the previous year) and ignore my Math gap much more so than the ivies.

Ultimately, Macalester was my first acceptance after the devastating UChicago ED rejection (which was pretty reasonable given my whole Math fiasco and they're a Math heavy school). I nearly committed to Mac lol! I was that happy.

But I continued onto RD, and waited for interviews, of which I got only three: Georgetown, Princeton and Harvard. No Yale interview was pretty much torture, and the Georgetown rejection basically killed me, but I was relieved to get the Hamilton acceptance. Ultimately, I was prepared for full rejections at the ivies, and on ivy day, I literally had my Dad's credit card out to pay the $500 deposit on Hamilton's portal because I was so sure of the rejections. Each rejection stung, but the first surprise was Cornell's waitlist. Then Princeton's??? Harvard was the last decision I opened, and I nearly had a heart attack when I saw a red banner and ""Congratulations!"" I literally committed on the spot.


I couldn't believe it. A college that had only accepted PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Math stream) students for as long as I could remember, but they took a Humanities student without Math. Sometimes, dreams really do come true. 


Fast forward, from Fall '17 to Spring 2022 (took a gap year in between because of COVID-19), probably the best four years of my life. Sometimes, I would literally stand in Harvard quad for hours in disbelief at the sheer magnitude of where I was attending college. It was just that incredible to me — little o me, a guy from the middle of nowhere in Vermont, now in Shimla, at THE HARVARD???

I ended up taking a gap year after I graduated, and am now at Harvard Law School's Class of 2026. (My gap year activities probably played a role in my HLS acceptance too)


Moral of the story: **Take gap years!** They can be a **game changer** if you are strategic!


It has been an incredible, wild, wonderful, cathartic,  humbling, and honestly, magical journey. I resented my parents so much for bringing me to India, and me needing aid, having a worse chance at literally every school. But as I rewrote my common app essay, I really could feel nothing but overwhelming gratitude as to where I came from and, as I write this post now, where I am today.



Best wishes to the incoming class of 2029.

*Guidance Counselor:* 7/10 Talked about me taking classes through Johns Hopkins' CTY (Algebra 2 and AP Comp Sci), but other than that I'm not really sure what he wrote. I think he knows me pretty well-ish though.

**Interviews**

*Princeton:* 4/10; pretty mediocre; struggled to answer some questions; connected a bit with music.

No one else wanted to interview me :(

**Essays**

Personal statement was about using concepts I had learned in jazz band (creativity, complexity, soloing) in order to improve a game I played with my friends (nitroball, if anyone has heard of it). My English teacher really liked it. He said it was one of the best essays he had read (like top 5 or smth).

Supplementals were varied. Brown was the best: I locked in on them and got pretty personal as well. I thought my essays for the other schools were decent. Princeton was definitely the worst though... (PSA: Applying early won't help if your essays are ass!)

   * This was my friend's dream school so I withdrew my application in case it could help him get in. I wouldn't have gone anyways since I had already gotten into Brown.

**Reflection:**

I started out with like 16 colleges I was going to apply to, but (obviously) that got cut down. All of the essay writing killed me. I spent a good chunk of time on a cruise over winter break writing essays... Looking back, I definitely procrastinated too much on the application process, but I guess it all worked out. I have to say that I grew a lot as a writer and as a person during this time. There was a lot of soul searching and introspection during the entire process.

Another thing, it's kinda crazy seeing how many schools other people apply to. I understand the shotgun strategy, but quality is more important than quantity is it not?

**Letters of Recommendation**

STEM teacher (7.5/10) - Wrote about my research mainly, and how he has seen me grow. He has known me for a few years, and we are pretty close.  
  
Lang teacher (8/10) - He wrote about my character and how I am a natural leader in and out of the classroom. He talked about my intellectual curiosity and said I was one of the best students he's taught. 

Counselor (?/10) - I'm not sure about this one since I never read it, and I think this could be the reason for my results (idk though). My counselor changed a LOT throughout high school, so I was never really close to the one who ended up writing my rec letter. She knew about my research since I applied to STS, but other than that, she didn't know much. I was going to give her a brag sheet and my details, but within a few hours of adding her to the CA portal, she submitted the letter before I even had the chance to talk to her. welp..

Research Mentor (9/10) - It talked about my ability to work with the research team, my ability to take charge in the project, and my intellectual vitality.

**Interviews**

MIT (7/10) - Pretty average interview tbh. He was straight out of undergrad so it was pretty easy to connect with him. I think I did alright in answering his questions.

Princeton (7.5/;10) - We had a very lengthy conversation (1.5-2 hrs i think) where we talked a lot about our background and experiences. He wasn't a STEM major so it was a little hard to explain my research, but he understood the implications of it and seemed to like my intellectual curiosity.

**Essays**

I worked with a private college advisor to write all of my essays and he helped me create a really good narrative to explain my research and my passions.  
  
Common App (8.5/10) - Wrote about how my close family member died of a neurological disorder related to pesticides in rural asia and how it led me to pursue research to try and find a cure for it. Ended with my long-term goals for this issue.

Supps (8/10) - Why us essay was a continuation of CA essay but with specific steps / resources at the uni I would use to pursue my goal. Wrote another essay about how/ why I started STEM advocacy and the non-profit and how I'd love to continue it at the university through whatever similar program they had. Diversity essay was about a religious difference with a friend and how I had them join me in a specific ritual and how we both learned a lot about each other's beliefs, even though we didn't agree.

I reused every supp, just changing it to fit the specifics of the university and adjusting the length accordingly.

To be honest, I did not expect these results at all, and I'm not entirely sure where I went wrong. I'm super greatful that UF recognized my research and that I got into the URSP program so it's not all bad, but I'm still pretty bummed out by these results. My UW gpa was definitely on the lower side, however, I calculated my academic index score and it was around 228, which is above the average for the ivies, so I thought I was fine.

**Final Thoughts**

At the start of the college application process, I had my heart set on BU. As we’d say back home, I was ready to be a proud “Boston Warrior.” It was my dream school—everything I had worked toward for years felt like it pointed me there. But because of my father’s concerns about financial aid as an international student, I didn’t apply Early Decision. When the decisions rolled in and I didn’t get into BU, BC, or Columbia, it hit me hard. I had always been a tryhard—the kind of student who gave her all, not just in high school, but since elementary. And for a moment, it felt like none of it had been enough. Like I wasn’t enough. I felt like I’d let everyone down—especially myself. But life has a way of nudging you forward even when you want to pause. I remembered what my guidance counselor told me: *rejection is redirection*. At first, I thought it was just something adults say to soften the blow. But slowly, I realized she was right. When I visited Fordham, something just clicked. There was a quiet certainty in the way the campus felt like home, like the universe was whispering, *this is where you’re meant to be.* Now, I’m proud to say I’ll be joining Fordham’s Class of 2029.

To those reading this who may have experienced or will potentially experience this: I know how deeply it hurts when things don’t go the way you hoped. I won't lie to you, it hurts a lot. But please, don’t let one “no” make you question your worth. The path meant for you might not be the one you planned—but it will still be yours, and it will still be extraordinary.

Good luck to all future applicants and I hope you can get into your dream school! And if you don't, that's okay! The universe has a way of getting you on the path that is meant for you :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k3a260/overachieving_hispanic_realizes_rejection_is/,1745107804,1350,,4,Hispanic,,,"* Rank, **Essays/Interviews**, At the start of the college application process, I had my heart set on BU.

**Final Thoughts**

I was in a pretty bad mental state throughout the college application process, especially since I didn't do much preparation the summer between my junior and senior year besides drafting my UC PIQs. I had a counselor for a bit but mostly had to write my applications on my own. My parents also pressured me to apply to a lot of schools (30 is much more than you really need) because of how many schools reject prospective CS majors with demographics like my own. There was also a ton of peer pressure at my school towards college applications, essays, extracurriculars, and getting into a top school. As a result, the first semester of my senior year was my worst semester academically (I had to drop my two heaviest classes and got my first B in high school) and I felt extremely depressed and anxious at certain low points during this period of my life. My original goal was to get into a top CS school like MIT, Stanford, or Carnegie Mellon but I ended up not even applying to those schools due to the sheer amount of competition. However, I still got some pretty great options in the end, and I'm proud to say that I'm committed to UT Austin for CS in the Turing Scholars Honors Program. Hook 'em!

Good luck to all future applicants and I hope you can get into your dream school!

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

English Teacher (8-9/10): I feel like I was a pretty good student in her class, and she has an overall pretty positive view of me. She also helped out a ton when it came to applying for pretty much anything I applied for.

Math Teacher (6/10): Honestly I feel like she might not have known me that well, I was pretty much in a corner in the class the whole time. I asked her for a rec anyway though since I was pretty much the only one in that class that wasn't super rowdy

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Princeton (9/10): I felt like my interview with Princeton got the message through that I was interested in something a little more unique to Princeton, and I was able to ask questions to the interviewer that hadn't been asked by others before. I know that this interview likely had no weight on my application, but it was still the only good interview experience I've ever had

Stanford (3/10): Awful interview, not because of the interviewer but because I was just an idiot. I got lost while getting to the interview location, and I basically knew I was cooked when most of my answers to the question were the same thing

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

QB Essay: (4/10). I worked with my English teacher on it, but comparing my writing then and my later writing, I can tell it was kind of mid. It was basically just my life story and my ambitions summarized in 800 words.

Personal Statement 1:(5/10).  QB essay but edited to look a bit better. 

Personal Statement 2: (7-8/10): I started a complete rewrite about 2-3 weeks before winter break. Spent all of that time and most of the end of 2024 writing it, but I think it came out as my best essay. It connected my cultural background with my life experiences and aspirations. 

Supplementals: Honestly I thought they were decent. Only ones that I know were 100% horrible were Northwestern, Tufts, and Stanford

I also did apply for questbridge, but was rejected, which kind of sucked. 





To be honest, I should have seen these results coming from a mile away, and I'm lucky I even got my acceptances. My ECs felt more like they had to do with teaching than BME (Although I did try to get a research program, but failed when I got to the interview stage), and my awards were lackluster and didn't really say much about me. My academic rigor was definitely terrible (and after attending an admitted students day at UIUC, I felt like I really could not compare to any of the students there).   
I feel like after I was accepted to my high school, I got too lax and had no idea what I was going to do to prepare for college. The college application process, and my results, hit me with a fat reality check and basically told me that I'm going to need to work harder if I don't want a repeat when time comes for grad school applications. I'm definitely glad for that wakeup call (and I know that if I had gotten into any one of my far reaches, I wouldn't know I need to put in more effort), and I'm glad that I still have an extremely good school to go to. UIUC gave me my second chance, so I'll be looking forward to making the most of my time there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k2vcw7/lazy_asian_gets_reality_check_and_wakeup_call/,1745066404,1520,,4,Asian,"RD UIUC Bioengineering, RD SUNY UB, RD SUNY Buffalo State (Direct admission), RD SUNY Binghamton, RD CWRU",RD UW Madison,"REA Stanford, EDII JHU, RD UMich, RD Cornell, RD Georgia Tech, RD NYU, RD Northwestern, RD Princeton, RD Stanford, RD Tufts, RD WashU St Louis, RD Ohio State University, Additional Information:**",Male

Got none except for Harvey Mudd which was pretty generic imo.

​

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

For my personal statement I wrote about chess and how I fell in love with it then started to hate it but then found my love in it again and how this taught me to chase my passions not my end goal. 

I think my why major and why us essays were pretty generic ngl. But I really liked most of the essay prompts that were on diversity/community. I talked about my involvement in the deaf community and how this helped me grow as a person here.

I also wrote all my essays last second. I started my UC application like the Saturday before it was due and all my common app essays on Dec 31st so they were for sure rushed but I lowk liked the end product for some of them.

**Additional Information:**

Honestly I really don’t know where I messed up. I understand that my stats with a low Class rank, GPA, and SAT that fell under the 50th percentile for most schools were pretty bad especially since my math wasn’t too high for engineering but I had no clue that it would be this bad. Also I had no clue grades mattered which is why I got so many Bs my freshmen and sophomore year but I later picked it up. I also thought that my max rigor would somewhat help me but ig colleges don’t really care about rigor that much.  My class rank was also heavily skewed cuz most of the ppl in my grade just gamed the system and took some bs online anthropology courses.

I really don’t think I’ll get off the CMU or Cornell wl but hope to get off UIUC or Berkeley, and worst case I’ll go to community college for one year and just transfer somewhere but I really hope it doesn’t come to that.

But ya honestly I really don’t have a clue as to where I went this wrong. I thought I would for sure easily bag SB, Irvine, and Davis plus at least one of my reaches but shit did not work out at all.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Calc Teacher (??): Have had her for 3 years now, we always crack jokes, always ace her tests, never use extended time. Think she likes me 

Counselor (??): Always been at my side to help with my Autism. Constant meetings, help with my college application, think she wrote a good one

Robotics Teacher (??): been with him for a few years, same as last letters, think they like me

**Interviews**

Princeton (5/10): Super nervous for this one as Princeton was my dream school. Very nice old lady who was a farmer (???). Kind of gave her lackluster answer, but still tried to keep a conversation going. When the 2 hour mark hit we were mid conversation, and she stopped it to leave, so that’s probably not a good sign.

MIT (7/10): Online zoom call with this nice man. We talked about traveling and marine ecosystems. Also kind of have bare boned answers, just nervous. But definitely better than Princeton.

Dartmouth (5/10): Not really an interview but we had a zoom call to be recruited by the sailing team. Just kind of sat there and asked a few questions, nothing too special. 

(Edit forgot Harvard interview) (6/10): A nice guy who just asked me the generic interview questions. Nothing special nothing unique. Had to do it in my school though which was a bit awkward. 

**Essays**

PE (9/10): Personally, I believe it was a 7/10, but my teachers and friends really loved it, might just have been embarrassed writing about the topic. Wrote about an accident I had while skiing, and how it deterred me from trying new things for a while. Generic but people thought it was really good 

Supplementals (6-8/10): Wrote over 70 essays, so some were very plain, while others (Esp Harvard, duke, Dartmouth) I poured my heart out and went full hyperfixation. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

**Acceptances:
- Rutgers EA (full ride with honors)
- Penn State EA
- Purdue EA
- UMD EA (20k)
- Lehigh (50k) RD

- Steven’s IT (EA)

- CMU RD
- Vanderbilt RD

- MIT EA (was deferred here, gave me so much hope)

**Additional thoughts:
After duke came out I was literally so crushed. I am pretty happy with where I got into, especially with the very cheap Rutgers admission, but I still find myself thinking about what could’ve been. I’m thinking of going either Penn state, UMD, or Rutgers because of the money and engineering prestige, and I have many friends going to Rutgers and Penn state, any opinions would be nice (gonna do premed as well). Wrote most my essays on wanting to do biomedical for prosthetics, thought that’d help. Did I just think I was too good, or was I really just mediocre. I feels like a waste doing so much in high school to just go to a state school for little money. Maybe I applied to too many schools and that hurt my essays, or maybe I left my Chromebook open and my friend wrote a bad word in my PE, I really don’t know. Maybe it was the three in physics, and I just didn’t explain the reason well enough, or I didn’t talk too much about my goals and autism. It’s just painful to walk around my school and talk to my friends who got into ivys and their dream schools. I just go to move on, but should I even try to transfer next year? I need to integrate into college life, and maintain a high GPA in tough classes, so is there a point? Anything would help, thanks.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Calculus Teacher 9/10 - she wrote me a recommendation that got me into my state gov school for sciences and engineering (~20% ar), we have a really good relationship and she’s the one who chose me for my best in ap calc award

​AP Chem Teacher/SciOly Sponsee 9/10 - we have a great relationship as well, she’s known me as a student for years, for ferpa reasons i couldn’t read her rec but we had a convo vaguely about what she’d write 

**Interviews**

Princeton 7/10 - was super casual and we met over zoom. she was a really interesting person and seemed impressed by/satisfied with what i told her

Dartmouth 8/10 - this was my first in-person interview, so i was super nervous, but my interviewer was pretty nice and chill. we had a super honest convo, and it was a great experience (side note: he asked me what my top school was and i answered honestly and said princeton 😭 don’t do this 💀)

Stanford 0/10 - i got sick and had to cancel 💀

​Harvard 6.5/10 - the guy was really nice and funny. he said i passed the “not a murderer test” and told me some of the questions i asked were really good. overall i think it was pretty average though, so not sure if i really stood out here

**Essays**

Personal Statement 7.5/10 - Questbridge schools got a slightly different personal statement than Common App since i shortened it and made it a little sharper after the fact. i typically do pretty well with writing and some people cried reading it but i don’t think was super cracked

​Supplements were okay for the most part. I reused most of them, and my results were pretty hit or miss

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

Got rejected from being a Questbridge finalist early on so this kinda put me into a slump + dissuaded me from sending in arts supplements bc of a confidence drop (big mistake). Transferred my QB app to rd (ea for case) and added like 20 schools through common app 😭

1k15ai5,"Peruvian Male Gets the Expected, Sort of…","RESIDENCY & DEMOGRAPHICS:

- State: NJ
- Income bracket: less than $40k
- Ethnicity: Peruvian American
- School type: Public High School ranked 150 in the state
 (it’s a decent HS that’s picking up the pace lately. Too bad I’m graduating now :P)
- PROFILE: first gen/single mother household with two other siblings.


STATS:

- GPA (UW/W): 3.28/3.54 
- SAT: 1400 
- Courses: 2 APs and 9 honors total
- Grade trend:
Started freshman year with all A’s from freshman to Sophomore year. Had two D+’s (one in APUSH, other in SAT Prep) and two C’s in my junior year. Currently duking it out in all A’s for Senior year (AP Chinese, Honors precalc, honors Env. sci, honors world lit, etc.) 

CIRCUMSTANCES FOR MY DIP IN GRADES:

- I got bad medical advice from my previous doctor and I was led to make some bad health choices that gave me fatigue, inattention, muscle weakness, and low energy levels. It really messed me up in Junior year. I got a new doctor now which is why I am doing better. 

MAJOR/INTERESTS:

Applied as a Chemistry major for most schools, some as Chemical Engineering. My interests lie in improving the energy technology such as fuel cells, batteries, and solar cells. I particularly have heavy interest in their materials.


Activities:

1.) Baking Business (10th-11th)

Ran my own small baking business with my homemade sweets. I raised a total of $1000 starting very late from Sophomore year to end of Junior year (so like one year total becuase I operated during school days). I also outreached to other business entities like local deli shops and successfully sold my products for resale. 

2.) Translator/ “American Ambassador” (11th, summer)

I was a translator/“american ambassador” or just group leader for a 5-day program held by the International Partnership of Education Research and Communication. My job was to help my own group of foreign Chinese middle school students who were part of the exchange program in projects, class work, activities, and made friends. For clarification, I am not part Chinese whatsoever. This really put my Chinese skills to the test.

3.) Scriptwriter/Director (independent project) (11th)

I was a scriptwriter and director for my own independent play that I made and collaborated with multiple voice actors (nine) to make it come to life.

4.) Presentation (independent project, 12th)

Made a presentation on oil chemistry and its effects, and held an audience of 30+ peers.

5.) Pre-college Rice University Program (academic) (summer of 11th)

Self-explanatory activity. I did it under Anatomy and Physiology.

6.) Poll Worker (work) (12th)

I snagged this job as a senior. I helped as a poll worker for my local election district during the presidential election. Got paid $300. 

7.) Club Member (Club, 10th-11th)

I was club member of my school’s interact club. I was a proactive member and snagged every opportunity I could get. Ranged from helping at food drives, to leading a small team during a color guard event. I enjoyed it and I accumulated over 80 hours of community service. 


LORS/ESSAYS:

- Chinese teacher (8/10) knew them very well 
- counselor (7/10) said that they loved my activities but they took my stuff from naviance template so…
- 10th grade English Teacher (8/10) I knew them very well too and they respected me a lot as a great student. They were also a teacher I respected a lot too.
- Anatomy & Physiology Teacher (7/10) I also knew them well and we had great respect for each other. Counselor told me their letter was lovely.

- Personal Essay (6.5): I struggle with self-reflection but the final product was enough to submit. 

- supplemental essays (8/10): I could actually answer the prompts and I loved the essays that I wrote. 

- If anyone wonders why I couldn’t get a teacher related to my major for LOR, I tried my chem teacher but they left and I couldn’t reach out to them. I’m doing physics right now because I took anatomy and physiology last year and I couldn’t take more than one science class at the time.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

My dip in my grades was attributed to the fact that I was given bad medical advice from my doctor. It led to some bad choices that gave me inattention, fatigue, and low energy levels. After changing doctors, I’ve been better, and now I’m back on track on performance (my teachers have also been giving me praise too which is nice). I expected most of my rejections, but when the NYU rejection came, I felt sadness, something I’m very unfamiliar with as it came from a college decision. I truly was not expecting to come off the waitlist for Stevens. I was already readying myself to commit to NJIT but when I saw the acceptance letter, I could not stop smiling! I’m committing to Stevens which is awesome for me! I can afford it since I can do without housing. Leaving me with $7k to pay.

Math teacher: Probably good aswell, I know her since I was like 12.  (8/10)

Councelour: Likely good aswell, we had a good relationship, although he might have mentioned I usually arrive late to school lmao.  (7/10)

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

UPenn: chill interview ngl nothing to say really (not considered in admissions anyway)

Princeton: Also kinda chill interview (although she confronted the fact that I wanted to potentially double major with how princeton has no double majors apparently)

Stanford: In person, went really well in my opinion, we connected well because he somehow knew about my dad's research (My dad is a professor).

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Really strong common app essay (had it reviewed) mostly about my internship in the solar panel plant and how solar pannels depend on quantum mechanics.

I think my supplementary essays where solid although I recycled many of them and in the end I think I emphazised too much on solar panels (to the point where most supplemental essays had something to do with solar pannels/sustainability/physics) I think in the end they where good but not *impactful* enough in the sense that a well thought-out and polished essay would be (I did most of them the day they where due).

**Additional Information:** 

*(anything of relevance)*

In the end I think I had good results. I am almost committed to Berkeley as it was always my largest reach along with stanford and princeton (thankfully I didnt get into Upenn ED Lmao) although I still have some concerns because it is a lowkey crowded public school and I want to change into Engineering physics, but apparently the change is pretty simple.

Looking back, I think being more of a 'simp' towards unis like northwestern, CMU or Umich could have made a difference as apparently they look at how much you are interested in them and I didnt send a single thing to them besides my common app application.

In the end, I think you can always aim towards top programs as an international as long as you have a clear focus and activities to support it (along with strong grades ofc). I recomend admitium's course for college admissions, it really helped me as an international with no idea about US applications.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k0vw87/international_mexican_somehow_bags_stem_t5s/,1744838668,1540,,3.885700104,International,"UC Berkeley (College of engineering, Energy Engineering major), Georgia Tech (idk but applied physics), UIUC (college of engineering), UCSD (engineering), Rice, UCSB (physics), Uwash (physics), Purdue (applied physics), UC davis, UCSC (60k scholarship), Manchester, Edinburgh, Kings College London","Northwestern RD, *CMU RD*, *UCLA*, *NYU RD*, *Northeastern RD (IDK why I applied tbf)*","Yale RD, Stanford RD, UMich RD, Princeton RD, UPenn (first ED deffered, IDK why I did ED I did not pre-meditate it properly), Cornell RD, Imperial College London (should have studied for the ESAT), Additional Information:**, (anything of relevance)*",Male

**Letters of Recommendation**

-Mine was actually from my AP pre-calc teacher my junior year. While I didn’t have an amazing grade in the class she really admired my drive and how hard I worked in a subject that was so challenging to me. 


**Essays**

My house actually like burnt down my freshman year 😭 but it’s not fully about THAT. I talk about how when I lost everything, I became extremely materialistic and obsessively bought meaningless things trying to fill the void of losing the objects that really mattered to me. I felt emptier and lonelier as each package arrived at my doorstep. However, a random digital camera I got on a whim changed my whole perspective. It sparked my passion for journalism and storytelling, allowing me to connect with others in a way I had never been able to!

**Additional Information:**
 
I had a lot of turmoil at home all throughout highschool and even middle school. After my house burnt down, I moved six times between rentals not always knowing if we would have a place to stay. My older sister has a very very severe eating disorder and has been in treatment for a long time. She had to go to residential at a point across the country and my parents took turns living there. These stressors intensified my OCD, especially my sophomore year, making it much harder for me to find the energy and drive when my only passion was control. However, I think that I worked hard despite my circumstances. Like I said in the title, I was always called “stupid” or “slow” by boys because I wasn’t as strong as them in math and science. I was teased for being a “feminazi” and a boy told me he was really upset we were so close in class ranking. Yet, I never saw them in AP classes of the subjects they struggled with. It feels good to be proud of my results.

4. 2nd in mixed media, 2nd in on site painting, and 4th in digital media at beta state 
5. NHS. It’s a big thing at my school kinda. They only let like 15 kids in out of all 400 students 

**Letters of Recommendation**

Aphug and European history teacher- 8/10 not sure what he said exactly but I’m sure it was good. I’ve had him two years in a row and he took me and some of my friends to Europe last summer on like an educational trip through a travel program 

Chem teacher- 9/10 she knows me really well and I’ve had her for 3 years. Can’t say much else about it cause idk what she talked about exactly 

Spanish teacher and now principal- 10/10 he likes me a lot and I did really well in his class. He’s also the principal now which is why I couldn’t take Spanish my senior year :(( but I think it looks good that he’s principal maybe idk 

Art teacher- 8/10 only submitted this one to washu cause she accidentally addressed it to them LMFAO😭 but I did read this one and it was good. I’ve had her all 4 years so she knows me well too 

**Interviews**
No interviews

**Essays**
I procrastinated this part for FAR too long. I basically wrote about my life story ngl. To sum it up, my mom died of a rare blood cancer when I was 10 months old and my dad didn’t want me 😝 so I’ve lived with my moms parents my whole life. They raised me and I had a pretty good childhood for the most part aside from the things I’ve went through mentally due to my mom dying. I had no sense of identity for a really long time. I felt so out of place and like I didn’t belong anywhere. Anyways, in middle school I had a really hard time and didn’t care about myself or my future, but I got better after therapy and having more support from my family. I decided my freshman year I wanted more out of life and that I really wanted to go to college and make something of myself. So yeah thats a very brief summary. I think it was ok essay judging by my writing itself but my story is just kinda good I guess. 

Not going into detail on my supplementals but they were okay also. I’m not big on writing tbh. I get really sad having to relive some parts of my life lol I prefer not to think about it. But I think I only wrote ones for vandy and washu, and they were abt non sad stuff so that’s good.

Physics teacher (8-9/10): I'm pretty close, been w them for 2 yrs, they gave me an award for being a good science student

**Interviews**

*Didn't really get too many and the ones I got don't impact admissions*

**Essays**

I'd say my essays are solid, for my personal statement I talked about my experience being an introvert and how that led to learning that communication is more than just speaking, and that sometimes silence but also understanding is important, tied it to my opinion a bit. Supplementals were p standard, I did good research on the school's programs and how I'd fit into them/what I'd do or like to do on campus and I didn't procrastinate so I got time to spend on them.

**Reflection**: Honestlyy I still don't know what to think at this point. Sometimes I feel really happy and excited about going to USC, but other times it's hard because everyone around me is getting T15s/T20s and there's that inherent comparison that I can't escape no matter what I try to do.

*Probably one of the weaker sides of my application, I didn't do much outside of competitive programming but hey I don't really regret that lol.*

1. Competitive Programming - All years of HS, I put liike 20hrs/week but it varies quite a bit - the summer before 10th I spent like up to 30 some weeks but obviously during school it's closer to 15-20. I don't even know man. This shit fun as hell tho
2. Programming Club Co-President - Bro tbh our club is just a college apps farm but this is here ig. We meet for 1 hr a week and just chill though lol. More people come in fall and winter and during those theys we'll have speakers / presentations / workshops but yea..
3. Programming Contest Organizer / Problemsetter - 9th 10th and 11th I helped test / problemset / organize some programming contest (9th and 10th it was an online one, 11th at a local school, yea they are separate). Both were super cool cause I made some epic friends but yeah it was very chill.
4. Competitive Math - Math community at my school is super fun :\]. It was only like 1-2 hrs a week because I do programming instead but yeah.
5. Testing / Problemsetting for CodeForces - Kinda fumbled this cause I don't think I conveyed what this is well, but separate to friends and stuff I have tested / problemset for the biggest online platform for competitive programming (a contest I did w/ a friend had like 30K participants lol)
6. Paid Work - I worked at a Ramen / Sushi shop the Spring of 11th
7. Walking my Dog - Ngl I was probably trolling at this point
8. Musical Theatre - I did the musical this year. So fun. Wish I did it for all 4 but alas :((((
9. Music Composition - For fun, barely even an EC but my friend and I would compose music together in 11th grade. We technically have an EP but it's really just yet another thing we've done together that is unfinished XDDD
10. SciOly - Also only 12th grade. I did Entomology this year. I'm not sure how much I like SciOly but maybe that's just a school thing. I loved taking the tests with my ento partner tho he's so goated.

3. Codeforces Grandmaster - probably didn't convey this well yet again, but GM is like top 1% internationally and collegiate (arguably a better demonstration of my skill than being a finalist but wtv). It's pretty redundant anyway but CF has probably been the biggest timesink of my HS career . Highly recommend.
4. National Merit
5. On my commonapp I put like some random ahh contests like 1st place at Cornell HS programming contest or Upenn but on MIT I didn't feel like putting that and just memed the rest of my awards (50 subs on Yt, beat an escape room at breakout games w my mates, etc.)

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Lang, CS, Sociology

I think my lang teacher liked me. (5/10)

I think my CS teacher liked me, and he is the sponsor of our club (5/10)

I think my sociology teacher liked me, esp I had her for like 3 years straight (6/10)

Bro tbh IDK how to rate this I mess with all my teachers heavily though.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

MIT: My dude was chill, he didn't ask me why I wanted to go to MIT or anything like that though. He babbled about like crafting a story and asked me questions to frame it as such but yeah he was nice. Hour or so long. (5/10)

Princeton: Very nice guy. We talked for 30 minutes about dumb stuff like Entomology, HG Wells, and math classes. Lowkey I forgot he said he was an Engi dude and asked him about his Senior thesis but hahahaha it's chill. (6/10)

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I have been inspired by my good buddy ezraft to post essays here. You don't wanna read them, they are not that good.

I would rate them overall a 4/10, since I talked too much about CS. In retrospect there are certainly things I could've written to seem more unique and appealing, but it really wouldn't be wrong to say competitive programming has been one of the most defining parts of my high school career. Another bad thing was stacking common app which was already about Cp onto some supps where I wrote about the other side (organizing), but hey man who knows. I certainly don't, I'm not an AO. Lastly, my writing is not that good lmao.

I will briefly talk about them below. My UT Turing essay is missing but it was relatively mid I think I wrote about something similar to my JHU supp.

Personal Statement: I'm not sure. I wanted to write about my babysitter cause lowkey she's the goat and I am very grateful for her dealing with me from K-2nd grade as I learned to become a functional human being. Also I'm still a huge Pokemon fan so I kinda wanted to write about that. Also the former programming club president has been super influential on me and we're still chill to this day. Idk really. 5/10

CMU: Talked too much about programming lol. Tried to fit in some music comp stuff but it doesn't read that well. 3/10

Cornell: Talked too much about programming lol. I did have fun at their contest though (I had to lie and say they wrote the goat problems but lets be fr...) 4/10

Duke: I don't even know where my other optional supps went. I know I copied them off of other schools though. 2/10

Georgia Tech: I talked about mushrooms cause I was in a mushroom sort of mood. 3/10

JHU: One of the later ones I wrote, so I tried to make a better story out of it. It's not very elegant though. 4/10

MIT: I don't like my ""different path"" essay at all. Definitely one for the rubbish bin. I think my other ones are okay though, and I had to fit Pokemon somewhere again because they obviously don't see my personal statement. 4/10

Princeton: The first essay is pretty horrid but for all ivies I wanted to apply for more than just CS so here we are. I think my second one is the best essay I wrote all season, but that isn't saying much. I think I like it because the friends I've made at my school are TRULY some of the best amazingest people I've met and they're gonna do so many epic pog things in the future but also I'm so sad I only have a month left with them... I also wrote about helping organize and teach at a local programming event and meeting like 6th-8th grades who wanted to do programming, which was super dope. I think I used that idea for most ivies tho. I inted the short responses tho LOL don't even ask what I was thinking 6/10

Rice: I yoinked the princeton one lol. Also like a lot of other schools I talked about ICPC because I am SO ready to try out for ICPC and not make the team but still have fun doing competitive programming in uni LFGGGGG (5/10)

UMD: UMD has the best supps and I memed on all of them tbh. (5/10)

UNC: One of the first I wrote cause of the early deadline, pretty mid though. (3/10)

USC: I wrote about a board game cause I saw a USC viterbi article about the board game. Anyway W school for the fun supps. (4/10)

UT: First supps I wrote, I talked about a work experience at the ramen restaurant but I never got to reuse it so it never ended up being polished in a future supp. The other supp I used quite frequently cause I think it's a funny story, my Dad thinks it's funny too. (3/10)

Yale: Close to the Edge is simply the best album ever. Tbh I should have wrote an essay about it but lowkey what is there to say aside from ""bro this shit so magical"" XD XD 5/10

**Additional Information:**

Anyway. Now for me to yap.

First off.

DONT BE LIKE ME APPLY TO SAFETIES OMFGGGGGG

Secondly

Do I have any regrets, aside from that? Not really. I am SUPER happy with my results and also, I had a blast in high school. I met so many cool people, did a lot of competitive programming, and fooled around online a lot. However, I clearly overestimated how strong my app was. And, well, that's okay. I've gotten amazing results anyways.

Anyway, after looking at past results and discussing with some other oly grinders, it's clear that different schools have different preferences when it comes to olympiads. One of my friend with an international gold medal had a Cornell Wl as their best ivy result (they still got into MIT, dw), and another international gold medal got rejected from UIUC. Of my finalist / plat friends only one got into georgia tech, and so on. In such a case I would say my results are quite lucky and I am super grateful (more on that later).

Do I recommend people do olympiads? Well, I'm clearly biased, but yeah. It is merely a matter of how much enjoyment you derive from them. I suspect most people will enjoy them quite a lot, and as such I recommend it. They are easier to get into than other extracurriculars, as all you really need to do is google the competition name and start solving practice problems, whether its Math, Physics, Coding, or whatever else.

The community, while a little weird and toxic, is fun when you inevitably find some close friends. The online contest I helped organize had people from CA bay area (duh), WA, NY, etc. Back then, I was USACO silver. In fact, for pretty much 2 years I was stuck at USACO Silver with no discernible progress. However, I kept solving problems genuinely cause it was just fun. It paid off, and the year I became got out of Silver I also became a Finalist. It was surreal meeting faces I had only known online for a year and laughing with them about stupid stuff or discussing programming problems. Much love to them all.

I met my besties for the resties at the Cornell programming contest where I proceeded to solve 0 problems, and met someone who randomly DMed me on CodeForces asking to team at UPenn (he then punched me in the face accidentally after celebrating our full solve of the contest). Turns out he was the cousin of my friend I met in English LOL. Crazy. And at Thomas Jefferson, another friend and I had the most anime shit ever where he helped reduce a tough problem into something I knew how to solve, and neither of us understood how the other's part worked but we solved the problem so trust. What I'm trying to say is, olympiads are FAR MORE than just grinding every day. There is a lot of that, but there are also friends, fun, and other fuzzy warm feelings in your heart.

Not everyone has put as much time into CF as I have, but I reckon they would not regret their experiences either. Friends don't give a shit about your rank. I helped out with the online contest while being silver alongside finalists (I also proposed an unsolvable problem that had to be scrapped lmao but shhh). Thus, your rank also doesn't matter for college apps. So, if the idea of olympiads appeals to you, try it out :\]. Don't worry about opportunity cost or whatever.

As a final note, perhaps it is weird saying I got super lucky with just an acceptance to UMD. I would've been more than happy to attend (TERPS ON TOP), but funnily enough I got an email in February saying I got Accepted by the UT Turing Scholars program even though the school rejected me. I joined the waitlist and the day after Ivy Day I got accepted (WHILE AT AUSTIN LMAO). The costs have come out alright (30k more than UMD over 4 yrs) and I am a committed longhorn!!!!

But to be honest, when I thought I was attending UMD I lowkey realized my college list was stupid. Most reaches I wouldn't even attend over UMD and applied purely out of vibes and prestige since I am lucky enough to be in-state for a goated CS program. If I could redo my list, I would apply to different reaches (like I don't remember why I applied to Cornell, Rice, or JHU, for example), and definitely more targets/safeties like Penn State, UMN Twin Cities, or UMBC. Ignoring Cost, which UMD absolutely mogs  every reach in since I'm in state, it seems I would meet more people who are as into olympiads as me at UMD than other reaches (aside from MIT, ofc). I know of a finalist attending UMD this year, and I have a friend with USACO Plat + USAMO there too (supposedly even a mopper). As such, now I would not be able to justify to myself applying/attending if i got in to certain reaches if I got in. I am beyond grateful that my two acceptances were UMD and UT, and not some other schools XD.

Good luck to the '26ers!

**Essays:**

I don’t want to seem big headed, but my essays I think were pretty great, and honestly I think my strongest point. My writing has always been really good, and I really worked hard to squeeze the most out of these essays. I got a little vague and existential in some of my supplementals, and lost a bit of drive to perfect them after a while, but overall, I’d give it a 9/10

**LORs:**

Dutch teacher (9/10): I set a historic streak in Dutch class with a perfect 10/10 in grades, many of them were subjective writing assignments, meaning my Dutch teacher actually likes me as well. Sit right in front of him every class, and know him quite well, we do “teacher feedback” at our school, where you basically get told what a teacher thinks of you, and he has always been overwhelmingly positive. Says I’m “probably the most naturally talented student he’s ever had”

Honors English and AP English Lang Teacher: 10/10. My favorite teacher and he told me I was his favorite student. Loved his classes and he loved my writing. Read over my local org's essay contest submission and recommended me for another writing contest this year (won!). Really wanted me to go to Harvard for some reason (sent me an email about Harvard's free tuition for lower income families lmao)

BioGeoChem and Honors Biology Teacher: 9/10. Second favorite teacher right here. She loved me plus she had my older sister (also loved) and younger sister (also loved) so nepotism lol? Minus 1 point because she said this was her first time doing a college recommendation, but I'm sure she did amazing. 

**Interviews**

None. 

**Essays**

Feel like my college essay was honestly 7/10. Not my best work and maxed the word limit. Wrote about this childhood comic I started back in elementary and how I only changed it to please my classmates' (my readers) expectations, which reflected my stagnant self and how I limited myself throughout middle school to people-please. Entering high school, I did big changes to my comic and myself for myself.

**Additional Information:**

Vent warning 🚨🚨🚨 Despite my absolute joy that I got into my first-choice school, I can't help but feel guilty about my acceptance when comparing my stats to those who were rejected. Like, I know I'm like at least top 3 in my school plus my President's award, but my EC's and overall application are so boring and lacking. I didn’t even do dual enrollment or do any internships or even have a job. 

I CANNOT WAIT for this guilt to go away so I can fully celebrate. woohoo

**\*\*Interviews\*\***

Didn’t get any but UPenn which doesn’t count for admission

**\*\*Essays\*\***

I think this is what led me to get my dream acceptance, I spent so much time revising them and developing them through the summer

**Common App Essay**: 9/10, Looking back, it was a little cliche, I talked about how my initial hatred for all fiction and poetry but grew throughout high school to understand that while I hate something, it doesn’t mean I get to put little effort in it.

**Supplementals:**

**Why Major Essay** (10/10): Talked about my internship and how although I loved CS, I wanted to help people and I never thought it would directly do that, but through the internship I realized I could

**Community Essay** (7/10, little bit of a savior tone looking back): Talked about growing up in one of the most diverse areas in the country (NYC suburbs) and how it forced me to always be an open minded person

**Big Moment Essay** (8/10, kinda overstated the impact and you could tell): Talked about the grant money and tied it to my narrative about the importance of communities helping each other (big story in my entire application)

**Essays:**

I'm not very good at rating my own work, my counselor told me my essays were all at least ""Top 5%"" out of the people he worked with, and everyone I showed them to said they were very good, but both of these can lowk be taken with a grain of salt

Common App - Probably 7-8/10, I liked this essay a lot. I wrote about Peer Tutoring in Math and how I helped this girl not fail an entire semester (tied into how I ""learned"" that everyone had the potential to learn which was lowk BS because I already knew that beforehand but its whatever)

Supplementals - Probably 6-7/10, I have a good style but I think my topics were kinda generic. I wrote about my love for math/engineering, volunteering, my Mock Trial team's community and how much that meant to me, and building up my STEM clubs from scratch (Rocketry was started freshman year and our Robotics Team is really really really bad)

**LORs:**

AP CS Teacher (6-7/10): I had rapport with her and did very good in her class but I don't think we were super close. She definitely liked me the most out of my STEM teachers (Physics teacher hated me and I was scared of my Calc teacher) so I didn't really have other options.

Chinese Teacher (\~7.5/10): She had taught me for 3 years and knew me pretty well, I think we had a good relationship but I didn't do anything super noteworthy in her class apart from getting good grades and participating

**Closing Notes:**

I am a little disappointed with these results. Everyone at my school thought I was going to get into an Ivy or at least a High T20 --I did not buy into this glazing which is why I didn't apply to more Ivies or MIT/Stanford/Caltech, but I still feel a little shafted (particularly, I expected a Berkeley or LA acceptance). I ED'd Cornell on my counselor's recommendation, did not think i would get in.

Deciding between GTech and USC. Spring admit and cost is not an issue for me (getting fall semester off sounds lowk really fun), it comes down to GTech having a better program but USC basically having everything else (location, social aspect, etc.)

I had pretty bad mental health problems in high school but they only impeded my ability to lock in on ECs and I still maintained perfect grades so I didn't really report them to colleges. I know outside of ECs there are a few other pain points like LORs and maybe Awards, but I was hoping someone with more experience could put things into perspective.

Essays

PIQ #1 topic: The leadership I showed my family when my mom started suffering from major health issues that caused her to not be able to care for us in the way she once could so I took on that role. (my parents are divorced so it's just her, my younger sister, and me), My writing style and diction were consistent (6/10), It was my best essay overall.

PIQ #2 topic: My artistic ability and how I expressed this. (I took art classes, and even did many artworks outside of school and posted them on social media, I was even able to have my art posted on my school's art Instagram page.) My writing style and diction were consistent (6/10), This was my third-best essay.

PIQ #4: My greatest struggle was my parent's divorce, It caused me to feel a disconnect from my academics because of a lack of availability (I lived 45 minutes from my school half the time), but still ended up taking harder classes and excelling in them by developing a routine to keep me on track of my academics. My writing style and diction were consistent (6/10), my worst essay overall.

PIQ #6 topic: Explained my journey through finding my love for chemistry and how I plan to utilize my chemistry degree, planning to go into the field of medicine and creation by working in different labs to create new medications to help more people through their health issues by giving them access to new and improved medications. My writing style and diction were consistent (6/10), my second-best essay overall.

One thing before I get started: My dad has a ton of medical issues (think 100+ surgeries, cancer, heart attacks, autoimmune diseases, and about 15 other things). Because of this, my family structure and my life has not been entirely normal. I’ve taken much responsibility from a very young age. I’m independent and I have done much of what my dad normally would have done. I've highlighted this in my essays, but I wanted to make this clear to y'all as well.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(Unfortunately, I wasn't able to read any of these, so I'm pretty much going off of pure speculation). 

Guidance Counselor (7/10) - We've got a pretty solid relationship, she's gone to bat for me a bunch of times, and I've been talking with her about college since freshman year. 

AP English Teacher (9/10) - She's got a fantastic track record with recommendation letters; students who have gotten into top schools have nearly always had a letter from her. She's the advisor for Student Government, which I'm super active in, so I'm sure she wrote a solid letter.

AP Government Teacher (7/10) - Decent past record with recommendation letters. I'm his student aide this year, and he's pretty reliable, though he did nearly forget to submit the letter.

AP Computer Science Principles Teacher (8/10) - She moved to a super wealthy public school in Texas last year, but I reached out to her to write my recommendation for MIT specifically. She was the advisor for FBLA in my sophomore year, and she was always a big supporter of me, so I'm confident that hers was pretty good.

**Interviews**

MIT (4/10) - This one was a mess. He asked me in the middle of the interview why I applied to a very difficult tech-focused school like MIT when I don't seem like the type to go to such a school based on my responses. That definitely threw me for a loop.

  
Yale (8/10) - I thought this one went well. Interviewer was nice, we talked about computer stuff for a while, among other various interests we both had. He said he'd write me a good recommendation and he hopes I make it in, which I thought was a good sign.

**Essays**

I thought my essays were decent. I worked on them for the better part of a month, had them reviewed and edited by a couple of my teachers and my peers. Some of the supplementary essays were probably kind of mediocre (most of them I talked about why I wanted to get into the robotics field), and essays that I submitted towards the end of my application process (Yale, Brown, Duke) were probably more refined than ones that I submitted earlier in the process (UF, GT, MIT). As for my personal essay, I talked about an interaction I had with a woman who threatened me over my diabetes, and how I overcame it to teach others about life with the condition.

**Additional Information:**

(Rant incoming, sorry!)

Back in freshman year, I decided to focus on doing things in high school that I would truly enjoy, not just things that would look good on an application, which is what nearly every college tells you to do anyway. I took the opportunities I was given, and, going to a painfully broke public school in the middle of nowhere, there weren't many. Because of this, my ECs and awards aren't the best. But I thought my academics and essays could get me some solid merit-based financial aid in-state, and if I was lucky, an acceptance to a T20? 

That didn't work out great, apparently. Part of me wants to blame it on some external circumstance. My counselor told me a week ago that even though Common App said I submitted my applications by the deadline, all the colleges reported that they recieved my application a day late. For a while, I thought that maybe it was some kind of issue with the submission, not the application itself, but at the end of the day, I guess it doesn't matter; the decisions have already been made. 

The fact is that this year was much, much more competitive than I ever could have imagined, and on top of that, I applied Computer Science, which from what I've heard was a complete slaughterhouse. Regardless, I'm definitely relieved that I got into UF. Everyone tells me it's a great school, it's cheaper than most schools, and it's close to home. But I'm definitely disappointed to see zero merit-based aid and no admission to the Honors program. 

Overall, I don't know what I'm so upset over. I applied to two safeties and one target, all of which I got into, and then applied to six reaches with the ""I'll never know unless I apply"" mentality, knowing full well that I probably wasn't going to get in, and now I'm disappointed that I didn't get into said reaches? Even when I got a waitlist from one of them, and I got into one of the best schools in my state? 

Anyway, life goes on. Graduate school is still on the horizon, and I can still apply for merit-based scholarships independent of the institution. I just wanted to take this opportunity to vent a little. I mean, what's the internet for if not complaining about your life to strangers? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jykowz/floridian_valedictorian_sweeps_his_home_state/,1744585809,1540,,4,White,"Florida Institute of Technology (EA) + $96k merit-based scholarship, University of North Florida (EA) + $20k merit-based scholarship + Honors program",Columbia (RD),"Georgia Institute of Technology (EA), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (RD), Brown (RD), Duke (RD), Yale (RD), Additional Information:**, (Rant incoming, sorry!)",Male

US history Teacher / MUN Advisor (7/10) - she knew me pretty well but I do think that she wrote it pretty last minute

Physics 2 teacher (7/10) I knew him really well, but he’s the type of guy who either locked in and wrote a great one or half assed it. No idea which

School principal (8/10) Worked on planning the MUN trip with her, going to school council etc. I think she really liked me.

Research mentor (9/10) submitted everywhere that would take a 2nd optional letter, but submitted it late. Probably my best one. 



**Interviews**

Georgetown (6/10) - first one, was nervous. Was a very average conversation

Harvard (7.5/10) - Was again, pretty average. Had lots in common with the interviewer.

Princeton (9/10) - My best one, but it was online. Talked way past time with my interviewer. 



**Essays**

Personal Statement (8.5/10) - talked about discussing politics with my grandparents and about conflict in the world today because of the inability to find common ground, and then connected it to how I want to be a diplomat

Supplementals - (6.5/10 OR 9/10) I had one really good essay that I wrote about growing up in South Africa which I sent everywhere I could. I applied to so many schools though that a lot of the others felt rushed.

This is probably where my application gets bewildering; really REALLY makes me wonder how much EC's matter to schools.

1. Personal distance running hobby/commitment, 6 hours a week, 45 weeks a year since 11th grade. Essentially just that I go for daily long runs (expanded on later in my app).
2. Tech Crew for my high school's theater program, since 10th grade, 210 hours yearly. Very time-consuming and shows personal passion, but anyone could do it.
3. Job as a soccer referee--U14 Certified under my state's refereeing committee, self-employed gig which is appealing? Just since this year working 4 hours a week though
4. Co-president of my school's cycling club, since 11th grade, organizing one 6-hour ride every month and leader of recruitment efforts.
5. Resource distribution volunteer at local food bank, 15 hours YEARLY since 10th grade, basically just helping to hand out food on the odd weekend.
6. Personal hobby playing piano, only since this year, 4hr/wk, just a passion project
7. Bouldering hobby, achieved V6 rank since 9th grade, 2hr/wk 20wk/yr. Basically just another sport thing I do in my free time
8. President and founder of school's Fashion Club, organizing clothing swaps and Goodwill trips to promote sustainable consumption in my city. Started this year. Eh.
9. Course setup volunteer for Chambers Bay Solstice. Essentially I set up a golf course for a golf marathon done by insanely rich dudes that raises $20 million once a year to buy golf equipment through a nonprofit for kids in need who want to play. Did this twice.
10. Couldn't come up with anything.

**Awards/Honors**

None.

Realized literally today I could've done AP scholar but that's 3 3's on AP exams which is useless.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lang teacher--everyone overrates these so I'm inclined to not give this a 10/10 but I really think it could've been. I had this teacher for two years (sophomore and junior for Lang) and got to know her extremely well personally. I didn't complete any projects with her outside of coursework but I did everything both years EXTREMELY diligently and me and her were great friends. She has incredible faith in me and I was consistently the best student in her classes. In tandem with her obviously being an articulate person I think she fought for me tooth and nail and fought well. 

AP Bio teacher--7/10? Only had this teacher one year but again we were close friends and I was incredibly diligent in her class as well. I did absurd volumes of work, way more than I had to for all the busywork AP bullshit and constantly pulled the classroom together, so I think this teacher knew I was a truly smart kid, but probably couldn't have expressed that nearly as well as my Lang teacher.

**Interviews**

N/A. Was offered an interview at Middlebury but I was too lazy.

**Essays**

Hmm. My personal statement was damn good, I know that. I'd estimate at least an 8.5/10.

I had an extremely unique topic (I think?) of my personal fitness journey competing with the laziness in me to lose 60 pounds and essentially go from wildly unhealthy to a veritable athlete in the span of 6 months in junior year, which I said reflects deeply on my character as a person dedicated to doing something and doing it well. I wrote about how equipped I am for the rigors and challenges of self-advocacy as a collegiate academic and how that experience both contributes to that fact and proves it. As far as writing quality I think I articulated myself quite (but not exceptionally) well. If I can pinpoint anything in my app that might've gotten me into NYU besides the obvious 4.0 and decent SAT, this is it.

My supps were decent at best. I really phoned it in on them. A lot of them were repeats (there were of course a lot of repeated prompts) but honestly I often just didn't have an inspired answer. There were two which I thought were standout, Carleton and Reed, but besides that nothing remarkable at all. I can't give myself above a 6 on the supps.

**Additional Information:**

I'm really happy I ended up getting into NYU. I'm going to go there, and I feel like a total imposter. I've seen posts on this sub where their EC's are 10 different Olympiad competitions, nonprofits they founded, coding programs that taught 2000 kids, internships at hospitals or meaningful things, etc. My EC's are literally just fun sports/music I liked to do and basic volunteering services that reflect good character but are also obviously motivated partially by the service learning graduation requirement. I never did a competition, got an award, honor, I feel like I read people's EC's and just wonder how it's possible to even involve yourself in such things. But maybe they really liked my essays, and I think my AP Lang teacher must've wrote a banger for my letter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jy1g64/lazy_white_kid_gets_into_nyu_for_no_reason/,1744526047,,,4,White,"New York University, University of Washington with the Interdisciplinary Honors Program (200 acceptances out of 9000 applicants, kinda lit), Reed College, Macalester College","Tulane University (no ED sadge, didn't find out Tulane becomes an Ivy in RD round until like March), Pomona College, Carleton College, Vassar College, Colorado College","Middlebury College, Columbia University, Additional Information:**",Male

**Letters of Recommendation**

* AP Lang Teacher (8/10): I didn’t read it, but I got her Adv Honors English 2 Award my Freshman year. We are like bffs, and she also has the same last name as me so she jokes that im her daughter💀 She’s a great teacher and a great person so I’m sure she wrote a fire LOR for me!

* AP Calc Teacher (9/10 —> 2/10): Shes like hella smart, scary, and a little crazy, but I credit her for all of my math successes (AND ALL MY STRESS OMG I TWEAKED💔). I’ve had like 4 classes w her so she knows me well. SHE ALSO SUBMITTED MY LOR 2 MINS B4 THE DEADLINE??? Minus 7 points for the STRESS😐 In all seriousness, she wrote a fire LOR im sure.

* Counselor (7/10): Soooo I never really formed a relationship w my guidance counselor until my senior year bc my parents didn’t believe in therapy/counseling and therefore I never saw it as an option (they do now🙏🙏🙏). She got me connected to an in-school therapist (who literally ditched the school later on😭) and knows all about my ADHD and depression. I assume that she wrote a good LOR about my perseverance through my declining mental health and struggles with my late ADHD diagnosis which has gotten a little better (WE GETTING THERE💪). 

**Interviews**

None😍unless u count Gates which was like idk a 7.5/10

**Essays**

* PIQ’s (3/10 - 7/10) - GANG I WROTE THEM THE DAY OF THE DEADLINE AND SUBMITTED AN HOUR LATE💔 i showed them to my English teacher and she said they were good and had a couple suggestions. I think otherwise…but an English teacher saying they were good has some merit…right?😟☝️it was pretty much me just yapping and i think i wrote one on literal shower thoughts🥀 dont procrastinate😔my ass was NOT getting into UCLA

* Common App Essay (9.5/10??) - idk i made it in AP Lang as a Junior and my teacher gave me a 95/100 so ig 9.5/10😼👍 i wrote about hair theory and my trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) and how it affected my confidence and self-perception. Horrible cycle of pulling hair, feeling bad, pulling hair to cope, repeat. But as I started to lock in a little, I grew back a lot of hair, finally got enough to get a hair cut, and felt more confident. HAIR THEORY! Though, AP season last year and first semester senior year really hit me hard and i had to start over. Trying my best to grow out my hair again😼✊
​
* BU Supplemental (7/10): The social advocacy prompt was like perfect bc i had already written about it for a PIQ. I just had to edit it a bit…which i did like a day b4 the deadline💔Talked about Tennessee’s horrendous anti-trans bills and anti-lgbtq+ bills in the country as a whole. Also how, as a lesbian, i have a duty to advocate for the rights of myself and others👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩 WUH LUH WUH‼️ GET ME OUT OF TENNESSEE I HATE IT HERE💔

**Letters of Recommendation**

School Counselor (6/10) - I don't think I really knew her well; just your stereotypical LOR.

English Teacher (8/10) - I had a really good relationship with this teacher, so I think her LOR was good (based on vibes). She was one of my favorite teachers I had at my time in HS.

Chemistry Teacher (8/10) - Again, also had a good relationship with the teacher. Might actually have a good LOR since the chemistry department isn't really well-liked at my school, so having a student actually like chemistry and the chemistry teachers might be new (yeah idk lol, again just vibes, but I really had a good relationship with this teacher)

**Interviews**

Lafayette (8/10) - Felt pretty good; Talked about my interest in the environment & history; said it was sad that the interview was only limited to 30 min. (College policy with interviews)

Lehigh (9/10) - One of my favorites; talked about my interest in the environment and being premed (with my father and all). Also talked about a potential research project idea I had for my senior year (I didn't end up doing it because of stress oof) that was essentially about gaming and psychology

Haverford (6/10) - Honestly, it felt like the interviewer wasn't really vibing, so it was alright.

Swarthmore (9/10) - My favorite interview; talked about my interest in history, politics, & the environment and connected it with law (the interviewer was a lawyer)

UPenn (7.5/10) - It was alright. Though, we did connect over my interest in medicine, especially when I talked about my anatomy teacher having giant posters depicting cell signaling pathways for cancer in the classroom

Princeton (7/10) - It was alright. Nothing much else to say.

**Essays**

I feel like essays were what got me into my two T20 acceptances since (IN MY OPINION) I have very okay/mid-level ECs.

Personal Statement - I talked about the idea of ""creation"" and ""destruction"" in my life through three prongs - computer science (yeah Idk where I was going with that), the environment (common theme if you couldn't tell) and my involvement with it, and medicine (yeah my father, + my grandmom having had breast cancer + family history of diabetes/other conditions on both sides) and how I would learn about the world through this lens. Coding could be used for good (e.g., making crucial applications) and bad (cyber attacks). The Earth is a beauitful world that exists nowhere else, but humanity has been destroying it. The human body is a complex machine that amazes me but diseases like kidney disease break it down, so doctors and other healthcare professionals act as ""mechanics"" to fix it.

  
Other Essays 

I talked a lot about my interest in the environment. For example, I talked about how I used my knowledge from Envirothon to come up with solutions tackling fictional situations concerning environmental problems from the competition. I used such knowledge during a mock debate in front of about 200 students for AP Gov  to talk about sustainable solutions if I were Pres. of the U.S. I also talked about my interest in medicine and the such.

My favorite essays though might be the Northwestern ones. I talked about how I would paint an image on the Rock (google it) symbolizing humanity's struggle to obtain understanding the vast universe while also suffering because of humans being humans. In another essay, I proposed a class where we compared events in anime to real world history.

**Additional Information:**

I really thought I had no chance at T20s this year because of how competitive the cycle would be (and ended up being) and because I felt my ECs were VERY mid (like your typical club stuff, no initiatives, nonprofits, projects, huge competitions like USAMO, etc.). I think my essay writing lowkey carried me for the two schools I got into.

**Letters of Recommendation**

English teacher (9/10) - I read it and thought it was pretty good, but considering my results and the rest of my application , it's fair to assume that this carried a lot of weight - had them for two years, close relationship, helped advise my #1 extracurricular

History teacher - I haven't read it and therefore won't rate it, but I only got this recommendation because I thought I needed a subject-area teacher letter for Georgetown (which I didn't end up needing, anyway). Sent it everywhere I could send additional letters, though, and I guess it ended up working

Vice principal - I haven't read it and therefore won't rate it, but we were very close and they are the reason my #1 extracurricular was as successful as it was. Also worth noting they are a Georgetown alum and wrote a separate letter of recommendation for them, but you'll see how that went at the end (there was also a general letter of recommendation for every other school, too)

**Interviews**

Georgetown - I thought it was fine, but I guess they thought otherwise lol. Only interview I had

Brown - not an interview, but my video was literally just me playing guitar (and I pretty lazily tied it back to social change through my interest in Bob Dylan lol)

**Essays**

I'm going to be honest, I thought my essays were just okay, but comparing my results to my application implies that they did some heavy lifting - a lot of my ECs/awards just don't have the impact a lot of other people's do. So, my personality must have come across quite well in my essays. My personal statement was about an anecdote that represented by desire to ""find my voice"" for the sake of pursuing social change, and the rest of my essays reflected that narrative. I will say that I was self-deprecating sometimes in my writing, but I think it came off as self-aware and worked well

**Additional Information:**

I figured this might be somewhat inspirational (or something) to people who have the academic qualifications to shoot for these top schools but feel like they don't have an ""edge"" in any part of their application. For me, I think it came down to what I was able to accomplish given the opportunities I had in a rural community + having a cohesive narrative across my entire application that seemed genuine. I actually had the opportunity to meet my admissions officer at Brown the other day, and they were actually the one to put my face/name to my application (in other words, I didn't ask to see them - it was happenstance). I think that speaks to my application, at least a little bit.

As for my rejections: Yale I understand, but I was pretty surprised by Georgetown - it was one of my last decisions, and considering my results up to that point were successful, I was surprised when I got straight rejected from the one school where I thought I had an edge (alum rec letter). I'm not complaining in the slightest, though!",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jxrnla/rural_white_kid_snag_ivy_from_poor_public_school/,1744492645,1540,,4,White,"Brown University (RD), Northeastern University (EA), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (EA) + Honors Carolina, University of California, Los Angeles (RD), Washington University in St. Louis (RD) + scholars program w/ money, University of Southern California (deferred -> accepted), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (EA), Villanova University (RD), William & Mary (RD), University of California, San Diego (RD), University of Maryland, College Park (EA), George Washington University (RD), American University (EA), University of Vermont (EA), Rutgers University, New Brunswick (EA)",none,"Yale University (RD), Georgetown University (RD), Additional Information:**",Male

**Letters of Recommendation**

Math Teacher - 8/10 Did very well during the class. Very nice and had good relationship.

English Teacher - 9/10 Was much closer to this teacher. I did a lot to stand out through group projects and other assignments.

Science Research Mentor - 7/10 Wasn't overly close, but still enjoyable talks and working relationship. Very nice during the mentorship.

*These weren't outstanding relationships where we constantly talk and everything, but what are important things are being very proactive (office hours, assignments), professional (typical student/teacher relationship boundaries), being active participant, and be excited to learn.*

**Interviews**

Georgetown (8/10) - decent, nothing crazy but a good enjoyable conversation  
Dartmouth (8/10) - same as above  
Rochester (5/10) - first interview wasn't used to it  
Yale (6/10) - second interview still wasn't that ready, prepare your interviews guys  
The College of New Jersey (10/10) - killed it  
Albany Medical College (6/10) - was good, but a flubbed one question  
Rutgers New Jersey Medical School (10/10) - amazing conversation  
Zucker School of Medicine (5/10) - was honestly burned out by then so my voice was dead they could probably hear it, but I thought I answered everything well

**Essays**

PS: I talked about my time working as a therapy assistant and paralleled it to being in theatre as an actor.  
Would mention that I had to write over 40+ unique essays and supplementals was really burned out by writing them all, but I also learned a lot about myself through it [🫠](https://emojipedia.org/melting-face)  
I would say the focus I had was to show what was my thinking process, values, and how my experiences intersect with one another.

**I have zero regrets. Advice though for anyone that also wants to do BSMD process:**  
Grades + SAT incredibly important (1500+/3.8+UW) - don't sacrifice them by stretching yourself thin over many ECs. Though I have a bunch my time was mostly concentrated on research, theatre, and therapy assistant (STEM, hobby/humanities, community service/medicine).

Research is very good for programs (not needed but I recommend) and participating in science fairs is nice added benefit, but you don't need crazy awards like ISEF, instead learn good lessons from it like how to stay adaptable and resilient even when experiments go wrong.

Essays: THERE are a lot of them. And the interviewer for New Jersey Medical School in open med school interview formats also gets to read them beforehand. Set time aside ideally in junior summer to really get to write all of them.

Shadowing: Very important to show that you have seen at least a glimpse of medicine. Calling hospitals is not the way, but find the emails of individual doctors and email directly. Another is if you have friends with doctor parents or connections and ask them.

Show both diversity and commitment. I really enjoyed working at that therapy organization, research, and theater. Theater isn't a med/stem EC and shows I have other interests I really enjoy. Show that you have tried things outside of academics and that you understand that a medical career isn't the only profession you could pursue. Find something that you really enjoy **completely outside** academics that you can talk about.

ECs that allow direct professional patient/person relationship: therapy work, customer service jobs, caretaker facility work. All of this can be useful to show that you've directly impacted and worked with people/patients in some ways more than hospital volunteering, EMT, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jxorh9/done_the_impossible_parents_said_theyre_proud_in/,1744484726,1550,,3.95,East Asian,"Cornell University + Hunter R.

**ADVICE BEFORE I SHOW MY RESULTS**  
***academics/standardized testing:*** genuinely the weakest section on my app. i did not take as many APs as other people on this sub, i did not have a perfect 4.0 gpa, i literally could not score over 1500 on a single-sitting sat. for classes, ofc always try to take the hardest classes but for God’s sake if you’re doing an AP course or an honors course, do it in something you would be interested in and can see yourself doing over a long period of time. i did in fact NOT do this and burnt out my junior year and my mental health was the worst it’s been in my whole life. for standardized testing, take **both** the sat and the act if possible to see which one is better, the sat was the only thing offered nearby so that was the only thing i took unfortunately, but i remember taking the act practice exam for funsies and getting a 35 whereas i could NOT score above 1500 consistently on the sat practices. also NEVER procrastinate studying, like you have to actively make time for everything—create a schedule!! God knows my mental health would have been much better if I had made one

***extracurriculars:*** would say that this was what carried my application. contrary to what it might seem, i did not use my parents connections for **anything** (they’re doctors and none of the things i did involved being in a hospital lol). i hate it when people shit on those who are chronically online but that’s lowk how i got into so many of my extracurriculars. i stalked instagram, i stalked linkedin, i stalked twitter, i genuinely spent so much time on those platforms and whenever i saw an opportunity that seemed interesting, i was like “fuck it” and just applied. REJECTION THERAPY WORKS GUYS. for starting my own organizations, always be aware of not only your network but **your friends’ networks**. i was super lucky to have friends with a lot of connections in canada/asia and to be in various competitions where i could actually network with people from different states/countries, and utilizing my network really helped me expand my organizations. a lot of my opportunities came from one another. like doing MUN allowed me to meet people with whom i would start my organizations with. being on the youth advisory council let me gain an advisory position in a different branch of the dept. of health and with an advisory position on the health authority. **butterfly effect is real you guys!!** also another thing that i really prioritized were extracurriculars which were **low-effort and high-yield**. im aware that these are usually hard to come by, but after some looking it’s really easy to find. like i would not do an EC where i had to devote an ungodly amount of hours to EVERY DAY, like that’s already for school LMFAO. when i was applying for various positions, i was looking at what they entailed and what was going to happen, as well as various expectations so i could properly balance everything. also majority of the advocacy/advisory things that i listed were temporary positions that required me to be there like once or twice a week/two weeks for a short period of time. like i probably cannot remember a time where over 5 of these extracurriculars would take up a huge part of my schedule at a time. my mindset when approaching these opportunities was one where i was asking what i could gain, what impact could i make, how many people can i meet, etc. additionally when writing about my extracurriculars on my app, i focused more on **impact** rather than the actual **process** of what i did. (i.e. what did i achieve? how many people did i reach? how much money did i work with? etc.) i discussed the actual process of how i did things in my essays. i think that really focusing on impact was what helped me stand out in terms of admissions

***my spike:*** contrary to popular belief, you do **not** need to create a spike for yourself in the 8th grade or freshman year. Trust me. My spike went from medicine to business to international relations to public policy to political science to environmental science. i wasted so much time trying to find things in my niche that i wasn’t taking all the opportunities that i could have been doing. My story is the amalgamation, the mixing and baking of four years of side quests. **you will find out so much about yourself throughout high school, do not put yourself in a box before you truly experience these years.** what comes out as your extracurricular list should be like a quilt, a narrative that you will tie into your essay. colleges want to see that you did what you wanted. of course you want to have a broader, more general theme you can tie back to, but sticking yourself into a box and restricting your extracurriculars to a pre-determined spike will result in a copy/paste application that is just like everyone else applying to whatever major you’re going for. (remember: so many people volunteered at a hospital, so many people do shadowing, so many people do research/science comps, so many people do HOSA/DECA/MUN). It’s not that colleges want someone well-rounded, i think everyone here knows that already. I think there’s a lot of cookie-cutter applications and then it makes it super hard to stand out. **forge your own path.**

***awards:*** awards are genuinely not everything that people make it to be. i mean yeah, you want to at least fill all five slots, but international/national recognition is not the end-all-be-all. i’ve met a lot of other incoming freshmen at the university i’ve committed to and when we talk about awards, local and impact-based recognitions can also work! I’ve met others who’ve gotten in listing various certifications!! if you DO, however, want to go for awards then a good way to do so is just through applying for scholarships whether online or local. I know a lot of my friends and other successful admits used this method. Like seriously you kill two birds with one stone: getting some money for college while getting another résumé bullet point. another idea is possibly getting a community grant if you’ve started an organization/initiative!! **also just so y’all know, 4/5 of the awards i listed were won during senior year…**

***essays***: now i’m not shakespeare, but i think my essays kinda kicked ass. I started really early in my junior year with drafting out essays (yeah i was really crazy about this whole college admissions thing…) one thing that helped me with making sure my voice/personality came through was literally writing out the whole-ass essay like a text, and then editing it so it had more decorum lol. Lowk super effective on supplementals. Idk it may not work for y’all but I liked this method bc it helped me to be 100% authentic without any of the pseudo-academic bs.

**ofc as always DM’s will be open and i can always give advice**

**REFLECTION**  
honestly this process has provided me with a lot of frustration, shock, confusion, happiness, delusion, etc. this is probably the most stressful time in most teenager’s lives, so always prioritize your mental health. some tips i have are to start early and space everything out as much as possible to not stress yourself. also getting brutally honest feedback from others is so important, you need people who may not always tell you what you want to hear! another thing is to never let anyone determine your potential/abilities, only you can define that for yourself. esp given that i could not score above a 1500 on a single-sitting of the sat and i struggled a lot with various classes in junior year due to depression/suicide, i genuinely came into college apps reaching for the stars. i was always told my by my parents/friends to not to aim so high and that i was not “ivy-league material”. First of all, there is no such thing as “ivy-league material” or anything of the like. everyone whom i have connected with at harvard has a super different story/experience. also just to clarify, i did apply to in-state safeties with 80-90%+ acceptance rates that i did not list here as to not dox myself🤭

**Letters of Recommendation**

Research professor - 10/10. This is the only one I read so it’s the only one I’ll rate. She spoke extremely highly of my work in her project and my advocacy for communities of color. Also helped to contextualize what our research is about and what my role is. Could not have asked for a better letter, this definitely helped a lot with my apps. 

English teacher - Probably good, she’s been impressed with my writing and I’m active in class but not much beyond that. 

Chem teacher - Same deal. Active in class and enjoy the subject but not a super deep relationship. 

Counselor - Didn’t talk to her a lot but I filled out a form to help her get to know me so idk. 

**Interviews**

Stanford (8/10) - First interview and was really nervous but my interviewer liked my story and we connected over some shared experiences 

Princeton (10/10) - Only 30 mins but she told me straight up that it was one the best interviews she’s ever done and that she’d write me the highest possible recommendation 

Yale (6/10) - It was alright 

Harvard (9/10) - We connected super well. Said I was her favorite interview in the past 4 years and she was really rooting for me to get in. 

Duke (6/10) - I didn’t really try ngl 

MIT (7/10) - It was over the phone since our Skype crashed lol. I had a concrete idea of what I want to do at MIT and what programs I would take advantage of and they took note. I also did an OCW class with a professor they had so we talked about that. 

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I LABORED over my essays. Common app was about feeling disconnected as a Native person away from my reservation but how my naming ceremony helped me rekindle my identity. I weaved that with how accepting my identity allowed me to confront our people’s issues instead of avoiding them, leading me to public health and using research as a tool for empowerment. Imo it was really well executed. 

Supplementals were more about how I want to pursue public health and connecting that to my identity and family history. I also talked a lot about SSP in my MIT essays. Super proud of them.

**Additional Information:**

I’ve been browsing this sub for forever so it’s pretty crazy to finally be making a post. For my app, having good stats and a good roster of activities was important, but I think what tipped me over the edge was my essays and narrative. Nothing I did was in isolation: through essays or interviews I connected all my activities to my story and my development as a person. Having something on paper is one thing but you have to be able to speak about it - why you’re doing it and the impact it's had. A few of my interviewers and AOs said they were really impressed with my commitment to health equity and Native causes and that was the overall narrative of my app. I knew what I wanted to do and that permeated through every part of my application. 

I’m still deciding between schools so advice is welcome.

I'm being very vague with this b/c I'm paranoid about getting doxxed 🙀

My school is (once again) very new, so a lot of clubs and organizations were founded/actually began marketing themselves in my junior year

1. Mock Trial - Expert Witness (11) - Witness Coach and Opening Attorney (12); Won most effective witness at regionals
2. Science Olympiad (11, 12) - Member (11); Resource Librarian (12) - Won 1st place at States in 1 category in 11th grade, and I won 1 more 1st place and a 2nd place in 12th (my LOCIs heard about this 🤑)
3. Personal Conlanging Project (10, 11, 12) - This was a big deal to me. It's basically a language I created for fun and I wrote a 100+ page reference grammar on it and it was the basis for several of my essays 😋
4. Part Time Job at Locally-Owned Grocery Store (11) - Standard part-time job; I didn't work very many hours except during the summer, but I worked throughout the whole school year
5. Volunteering Role at Local Organization - Not a huge deal, but I helped out at charity galas and youth education camps; kinda social mobility/social entrepreneurship-oriented, but I'm being vague so I don't get doxxed
6. School Choir - Tenor Singer (9, 10, 11) and Assistant Musical Librarian (10, 11) - Basically just rehearsed a lot in and out of school and helped sort my school's music collection of 100+ pieces in my free time
7. Linguistics Club - Founder (11, 12) - Worked with the head of my school's foreign language department to organize lessons and games relating to linguistics
8. Linguistics Self-Study (9, 10, 11, 12) - I taught myself linguistics content to a decently proficient degree (if you can't tell, linguistics is like my one and only interest LMAO)
9. Piano Lessons (10, 11, 12) - I took weekly piano lessons and practiced pieces daily; progressed over 3 levels of skill, learning over 50 pieces; I was not very good

2. SC Science Olympiad 1st Place Medal at States

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

English 2H Teacher - 8-9/10? - I didn't get to read this one but I did very well in her class and I used to stay after class sometimes and chat. Literally one of my favorite teachers ever.

Chem H Teacher - 7/10 - I got to read this and it was super nice and personal but sorta generic too? I did well in this class and I was fairly close with this teacher as well  
(Also this was a junior year class for me because at my school you have the option of taking what's basically Environmental Science freshman year instead of Bio)

Counselor Rec - 8-9/10? - I also didn't get to read this, but my school has personalized meetings with your counselor to help write these letters and my counselor seemed very excited to write my letter (and she's my queen I love her).

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

University of Rochester - 7/10 - Fairly solid, but I asked more questions than she did 😭😭😭

Middlebury College - 9/10 - My interviewer was literally like me in the future but maybe more bald. Almost perfect.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Common App Personal Statement - 8/10 - Basically about how I fell in love with linguistics and how it's shaped me as a person

UChicago Essays - 8-9/10 - These were so fire to me when I wrote them but now that I look back maybe they were too flowery? I did a day in my life thing for the Why UChicago Essay and I chose the prompt about slang words that should be revived

Brown Essays - 7/10 - Pretty good but kinda basic

Cornell Essays - 8/10 - These were super personal to me and got a good message across even if they were a little robotic; I talked about a park in my neighborhood and briefly mentioned my love for cooking

USC Essays - 9/10 - I talked about the detriments of car-centric urban planning in regard to public health and a big tree in my childhood backyard. I also talked about Mitski and Ursula LeGuin in my short responses if you even care 💔

UMich Essays - 3/10 - HELL NAW these were so boring and robotic

UVA Essay - 7/10 - Talked about my love for cooking, but still kinda basic

BU Essay - 7/10 - A very standard why us essay

W&M Essays - 8/10 - Very similar to my Cornell essays

Okay enough with essays

**Letters of Recommendation**

pre-calc, calc ab, calc bc, and stats teacher (no idea/10) - yes, he's all of them. he won't let me read the letter, but i would assume it is good considering the things i've gotten into. we have a pretty good relationship since i've known him for 2 years now, and he's taught me literally all my advanced math. i'm pretty sure it's good, and if it's not, oh well.

ap physics teacher (5/10) - i only knew her for a year, and during that year, i barely saw her since i had to skip her class a majority of the time (to do something else for the school). the letter was pretty general, so yea.

composition professor (7/10) - i love her so much. i didn't have any english teachers for my first 2 years in hs until she came along junior year as my comp. professor for my dual credit course. we hit it off pretty quick, and her letter was generally pretty good.

**Interviews**

mit (5/10) - my first interview. i honestly forgot a lot about what happened during the interview, but i remember thinking afterwards on how mid it was. it was definitely because of me since i was not prepared.

rice (9/10) - i absolutely loved my interviewer. we were laughing and joshing around. i was pretty confident in all my answers, and we had a fair amount of common interests.

yale (6/10) - pretty similar to my mit interview except my interviewer knew a lot of my situation regarding my school since he's from my region (my school doesn't have the best academic reputation). my answers were pretty basic, and i don't really think i made a lasting image.

**Essays**

personal statement - wrote about the doll house i built with my sister as a kid and how each component connected to my life. since i did it really last minute, i couldn't really make it as good as i wanted it to be.

supplementals - i did all my essays the day of, and i really regret that. i am the biggest procrastinator on all planet earth, and i think it's just in my dna to do that, i guess😭. nevertheless, they're pretty good for last minute essays, and there were some really good one-liners that connected my whole narrative.

4. John Locke Institute Essay Economics Contest, High Distinction: INTL, 5% of all shortlisted candidates
5. National Merit Scholars Commended Student: National, 3-4% of all scores.

**Letters of Recommendation**
APUSH (6-7/10): Only student to get a 5 on APUSH in the past 2 years + did a bunch of essay contests “under him” as in running it by him. He probably chatGPT’d it. 

Spanish Teacher (7-8/10): Probably the closest to him of all the students in our grade. always complemented me on how I’m the only non-native speaker who only speaks to him in Spanish, and he rly likes how I try to involve myself in Latin American culture and speak and learn from Native speakers. It might’ve been slightly generic tho as he had like 10-15 kids ask him for recs. 

English Teacher (only for Georgetown): She was pretty indifferent to me and I honestly think she also ChatGPT’d my rec letter.

Research PI’s (8-9/10): Goated rec letters. They really liked me, had a deep interest in my success, and helped me a lot. Very positive and also showed my academic side and interests. 

**Interviews**
None for Harvard, Duke, or Yale

Princeton (4-5/10): Went in overconfident and nervous at the same time. Just didn’t click well with the interviewer at all and ended in 40 minutes. 

Dartmouth (7/10): Thought this interview went really well as I really vibed with the interviewer and got to discuss my interests for a while as well as show my intellectual curiosity. Went for 1 hour and 30 minutes. 

Georgetown (9-10/10): Wasn’t caught off guard by any of the interviewers questions and vibed really well with him. He was really surprised by some of my responses and we just had a great conversation overall. Definitely my best and most authentic interview.

**Essays**
Looking back, I think they were above average but a bit too cliche and honestly just a bit inauthentic. They were also a lot more rushed than they should’ve been as I procrastinated the deadlines far too much. Not bad but not as good as they should’ve been.

Reflection: Honestly, have more belief. I wish I would’ve had a higher self-esteem and more confidence in myself and my abilities throughout the process because I think my lack of it led me to become unmotivated and undisciplined in writing my essays. I’m very happy with Georgetown SFS, but I think my obsession with Ivies isn’t letting me appreciate it enough. Other than that, I also wanted to post to show other kids with bad GPA’s that it is possible to get a good school/program but also that so much of it comes down to luck and fate. I’m also not mad I spent most of high school grinding for college, but I would tell all of you to take a step back and relax because I’m still seeing the effects of my 4 years worth of obsession with college apps in a negative way.

1. Founded and led a chapter of a nationwide org to spread diversity in the Classics, led meetings in libraries and held forums. Lowkey everytime I tell people I'm into Latin or want to study Classics I feel double-judged, first because they think it's irrelevant and then second because there's def a reputation there as a ""white, elite, and male"" field. Don't really blame them bc Classics has been used to justify some heinous shit in the past like uhh slavery. But I want to change that :) There was a very kind professor associated with this org who wrote a rec for me.
2. Very selective summer program at HYP Classics Department, full-ride including plane ticket and 7 weeks long. Learned 1 year of college-level Ancient Greek in 7 weeks, attended workshops about Classical reception and some really cool opportunities at museums and manuscript libraries. interviewed with prof and wrote essays to get in. Made good connections with the faculty there, they were really nice and smart. Took 4 hours of greek per day and asked the grad student instructor to write a rec for me, which he generously agreed to !!
3. Research Assistant, this is with the same professor who I do my first extracurricular with. I reached out to him for this position, it’s just me and one of his undergrad students! I'm mostly just taking notes on some ancient texts for his book but it's very interesting, esp bc it intersects with another field! I will be credited when the book is published :o
4. NJCL/CAJCL stuff. which is nerd league of latin things. I was a Member-at-Large but competed and won a lot of events by myself before founding a school chapter. Won merit scholarships to go to conventions. Mostly just got some good awards out of it and good friends
5. ARCHAEOLOGY FIELD SCHOOLS bro i actually loved these so much they were so much fun. went to two, one at a spanish roman site and another at a native american site in illinois. it was very cool to compare the different archaeologist techniques between the sites and FEEL the history myself. excavated loom weights, hairpins, coins, piece-plotted, made good friends. wrote about these experiences in some supplementals. Won a merit scholarship to attend ok i will shut up now
6. Published Paper in a Journal. ahh yes i fell for the research trap but its ok. i wrote about Roman outward military brutality's relationship to internal strife which i feel like is so important to talk about bc it un-glamorizes Rome a little
7. volunteering at an outdoor-kinda-thing

8-10) other volunteering at things specific to my interests in archaeology. also scuba diving, social justice things/clubs related to my race. just things to show that im lowk normal.

**Awards/Honors:** 

1. Perfect Paper (Top 1.93% of 3,930) & Gold Medal, National Latin Exams, Advanced Latin Poetry & Prose
2. 1st, 3rd, and 4th Place, Reading Comprehension in Latin, CA & National Junior Classical League
3. 2nd Place, Certamen, Quiz-Bowl, won as solo member against 17 teams of 4, CA Junior Classical League. i competed solo bc I was a Member-at-Large and it was very nerve-wracking so im proud of this, although i lowkey fell off so hard after this 9th grade win hahaha
4. National History Day, selected as 1 of 3 students representing my county
5. my published paper (girl pls sybau)

Additional info section: Talked about a personal family cicumstance which my counselor knows about.

**Essays**

The way I feel about my essays fluctuated during the college app process, but now in hindset, I think they def complemented the rest of my application. I think my personal statement was very good, I talked about one of my favorite Roman empresses and how I related to her with a very niche experience :) i guess there was some ""guilt-tripping"" in the beginning but i very clearly connected this to my nonprofit activities in spreading diversity in the Classics, so like an optimistic outlook. Worked hard on letting my personal voice shine through. 

I def worked the hardest on my Stanford supps because I originally planned to REA but then procrastinated. But these were my babies!! I did think I leaned too hard into the social justice ahh diversity ahh side a bit, sometimes I think I sounded patronizing. But they definitely stood out which is what I was aiming for. They showed I was passionate and dedicated in the general theme of my application, but also curious and quirky iykyk. Made jokes. 

The rest of my supps, I procrastinated on during winter break. A lot were re-used haha. I didn't like some of them, loved others, i've gotten into schools i didn't like my supps for. I don't think I'm too much of a shabby writer but I wrote a lot of these at 4 am deliriously past the deadline. 

The general tone of my supps, though, was just introspective and tied into various ECs I've done, showing the reasons why I did them, what i did, how they've inspired me, imaginations, etc. 

**Interviews**

I interviewed at all schools that offered me an interview, including Yale. All of them went pretty good I guess, but sometimes I have the tendency to ramble a lot or speak unclearly so like i don't know. none passed 45 minutes. Also for some reason, two of my ivy alumni interviewers literally were parents at my school? i go to a small school so it was awkward on my end haha

some highlights:

\- my dartmouth interviewer being hot

\- my yale interviewer telling me ""you probably will have so many good schools to choose from, please keep me updated""

But def none of the amazing, earth-shattering, 3 hour interviewers described here that end with the interview adopting u as their new child! but thats okkkk 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

I applied to all my schools RD (22 total, including 4 UCs). That is because I planned to apply to Stanford REA and procrastinated. 

***Acceptances:*** **(list here):**

Amherst (I GOT IN EARLY in February, and i didn't even know they did early acceptances. the letter said they gave early letters to 140 applicants out of 15k students. my first acceptance ever and lowk cured my cynicism abt my future results).

Fordham (with National Merit full-tuition)

Brandeis (w/ merit scholarship)

**Closing Thoughts:**

Well, that was very unexpected. my counsellor was lowk saying in the beginning how we should work with the uchicago waitlist if we get one, so I wasn’t expecting to get into 5 ivies and Stanford?? Im so indecisive rn because Stanford has been my dream school for so long, is closer to family, PERFECT WEATHER, but I feel like Yale students have more diversity of interests, have a better community, idk…it’s not just sigma grindset duck syndrome like Stanford. Every Yale student I have met is so engaged, thoughtful, and welcoming. Bro even my fucking dentist today, I was sitting in the chair and telling him my dilemma and he said, I have so many friends at Yale and they LOVED IT then thrust his fingers into my mouth. I guess I see less ppl ride or die for Stanford? Idk…. But I get seasonal depression and Stanford was my dream school since I was a fetus, it has ideal weather, plus Stanford is King in California… guys help me pls lmfao. I feel so lucky to be in this situation but genuinely I don’t know man.

Although majoring in Classics, the current plan is to also be pre-med in college.

The other thing is financial aid, I only have to pay 30k per year at Columbia while Yale expects significantly more and I have yet to receive my Stanford offer. I’m writing a letter to Yale to ask them and have scheduled to meet with their finaid office on Wednesday to hopefully get them to match Columbia’s offer (I also have some financial circumstances not on the fafsa). So hopefully we get all of that, and Stanford’s offer, resolved in time before may 1. 

I’m planning to go to both admit weekend and bulldog days!!

**Essays:**

Common App Essay (8/10): I really think I cooked with this one ngl (and it won a writing award so I feel validated lolol). Didn’t talk about STEM at ALL, talked about important essays/books/art pieces that helped me grapple with my identity and how they shaped my worldview and forced me out of my shell, kind of like a glorified list but with a narrative?

Supps (7/10): recycled a LOT not going to lie, but I still think they ended up pretty ok, the schools I applied to last-minute definitely took the biggest hit in terms of originality, other than that I feel like I talked about a wide variety of topics.

Reflection: 

After how badly my EA round went, I was really losing my mind. Over winter break, even before the public school EA decisions, I added like 8 colleges to the list and applied to them frantically even though I couldn’t really picture myself at a lot of them. My advice is to NOT do that if you can help it…

Brown was really, truly my dream school for so many years. I loved Providence, I loved the open curriculum, I loved the campus atmosphere. I had it stuck in my head that as a highly interdisciplinary student (read: scattered af) I could only be happy at a school like Brown. I’m really dreading having to actually, finally choose between STEM and humanities for my career (because writing is my first love, but like, money).

Anyways, I am so beyond grateful for all the incredible schools I got into. I’m still actually shocked. All through high school, I constantly stressed myself out about getting STEM ECs/accomplishments and was kind of miserable. Writing was my escape, my side thing, that I didn’t give that much weight to. But in my interviews, it’s like they could see right through me. Most if not all of them wanted to talk about my writing more than my research. I guess this just goes to show people can tell what you’re passionate about, so don’t push whatever it is aside just because you think it’s like not as valuable to your intended major or society as a whole.

It's at [**https://re.ject.ing/**](https://re.ject.ing/) . This is the activity that I referred to in my title. 

**Awards/Honors:** AMC10 honor roll

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** 

My essays were average at best. I did not have a counselor and was doing everything by myself. Most of them were rushed (as I only began applying in October, which is one month to write my Common App essay).

**Additional Information:**

I come from the worst demographic: international male, CS major, no legacies, needed lots of aid. Therefore, I didn't expect anything, and these results are completely justifiable. As for my acceptances, I cannot afford to go to any of them. The punching continues. 👊

PIQs for UCs 7.5/10: 
- I have always been hyper independent due to working parents (like 14hr shifts) and my sister resenting me. I was always alone and was forced to entertain myself, causing me to fill my time learning a bunch of different arts and crafts, which helped me build a library of skills (like great pattern recognition and spatial visualization). An example I used is building structures out of greasy cardboard and my imagination in the back of the grocery store my parents worked at. This got me interested in understanding structures around me and honing in on civil engineering
- also wrote about how I had to fend for myself in terms of finding STEM resources bc my school focuses on agriculture jobs 
- wrote them in a few days and I thought they were great at the time but looking back I wish I would have been less formal in my tone. 
- I had my friends and my counselor review them and they said they were good so maybe i am overthinking.

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

* Clubs - captain of science olympiad and math clubs, founded a quiz/science bowl club, participated in Model UN until COVID lockdown
* Science Fair - I participated since middle school and qualified to state science fair every year, but I never got ISEF partially because of procrastination and partially because I refused to find and take mentorships with researchers. Not always, but more often than not, I saw that many of the people who took mentorships and brought their projects to the regional fair did none of the work on their project and were merely just presenting the work their mentor had done for them.

* Music - played instrument since elementary school
* Swimming - swam since age 3, opted to stay in club swimming and not join high school swim team even though I could have made varsity because I didn't like the people on the team

**Recommendation Letters**

*I didn't see any of the letters my recommenders wrote nor did I ask to.*

* University of Minnesota professor (8/10) - I had this professor for Calc II and Calc III and was a teaching assistant for him when he taught Calc III.
* School counselor (10/10) - I had talked to her a lot throughout high school so she knew me pretty well and liked me.
* English Teacher (9/10) - She wrote a unique recommendation letter for MIT. The only issue was that it had been a couple of years since I had taken her class and I hadn't really been in contact with her.

**Interviews**

* MIT (9/10) - The one thing that went poorly is my internet went out in the middle of it, but I got to have a really fun conversation with my interviewer for about an hour and a half. He even asked me some technical questions about projects that I had worked on which I thought was cool.
* Other interviews (Princeton, Penn, Stanford) were just okay, borderline bad, probably 4/10.

**Essays**

* I started writing my essays in June with the plan to apply EA to as many schools as possible. Unfortunately, I decided to not submit many EA applications because I wanted to see if I could improve my SAT score. Looking back, this was probably a mistake since I was ready to apply EA to most schools that had it available. 
* I felt confident about my common app and had it reviewed by several teachers. The essay was a story about how I started volunteering to teach math and science to kids, beginning as someone who struggled with teaching and how I improved as an educator and person.
* I probably spent the most time on my MIT essays since that was my dream school, and I felt pretty satisfied with the quality of those essays. I wrote about rock climbing, stories volunteering to coordinate an elementary school science fair, and projects I had worked on. I also submitted a maker portfolio.
* My CalTech essays were the essays I felt the best about. I wrote about how I self taught myself programming, my experience doing science fair in high school, and some stories about working in a group in my math class at the University of Minnesota.
* My UC essays and most other essays were essentially modified versions of my MIT essays.
* A major topic in a lot of my supps was that I was interested in AI policy and wanted to double major in CS and poli sci.

**Reflections**

The COVID lockdown happened from when I was halfway through 10th grade until the end of 11th grade, and like for many people, it threw off my motivation and discipline. I barely maintained a 4.0 through 11th grade, and performed a lot worse than I should have on standardized tests.

For the first several of months after all my decisions came back, I was left feeling disillusioned by the entire process, and being in waitlist limbo for several months didn't help. I spent a lot of that time hopelessly contacting the admissions offices of the colleges I was waitlisted at and sending letters of continued interest. I was (and still kind of am) a pretty big prestige whore, so for the majority of my freshman year of college, I was seriously considering trying to transfer somewhere ""better"" but eventually I convinced myself against it because I eventually didn't think it would actually be beneficial to my success.

When I started college, I ran into the usual problems that many people have - bad roommates, trouble making friends, not eating enough etc. - and at first I was convinced that those were problems with my university, but the realization that I would have likely ran into some, all, or even more of those issues at the other schools I coveted and that they were totally independent of the school itself changed my perspective on things.

Now that I am nearing the end of my junior year in college, I am pretty happy with my decision to choose Madison because of the cost and the fact that I was able to skip many prerequisite courses due to AP and University of Minnesota credit that likely would not have been accepted at other schools. While I would have loved to have been accepted into one of my dream schools, I don't harbor any regrets from the college admissions process. While there were numerous things I could have done better in hindsight, I felt like I always tried to make the best decisions I could with the information I had at the time.

The only thing I remember really hating from the process was filling out self-reported academic records.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jt3uus/indian_cs_boys_journey_through_waitlist_kingdom/,1743971793,1490,34,4,South Asian,"University of Minnesota (EA), University of Wisconsin-Madison (EA) (chose to go here), Purdue (EA), UC San Diego","UC Berkeley (applied to EECS instead of CS), CalTech, Duke, UIUC, Michigan","MIT, Stanford, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, University of California-Los Angeles, University of Southern California",Male

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lang 9/10: she was my biggest fan since day one. She loved my whole narrative of coming in the US alone and stuff like that. She was also a recruiter for jobs so I think she knows how to write a good rec. Her eyes were literally glowing when I asked her for one.

American CS teacher 7/10: Teacher loves me, but most of his letter seemed a bit AI. However, there is one paragraph I am 100% he wrote that really bumps up the grade of the rec letter. Overall I can't complain.

**Interviews**

Princeton 7/10: first in-person interview so I was pretty nervous. Other than that we talked for an hours and he seemed pretty invested on my story, asking me a lot of follow-up question and details. Overall for the first time it seemed pretty good.

Dartmouth 10/10: I literally did this IN FRONT of my counselor because I was in school during the interview and her office is the only quite place. The interview was supposed to last 30 minutes but it dragged for more than an hours. It was a phone interview (no video) and the interviewer was soooo invested in my story. After that I sent the thank you letter and she literally said ""I believe you are a great fit for Dartmouth!""

Stanford 9/10: the interviewer didn't show up the first... which was actually perfect! She apologyzed a lot and the second time I was A LOT calmer and she already had a somewhat positive view on me. The interview was more concise but she also seemed really intrigued by me. If you are wondering this was on zoom.

Harvard 8/10: I went to Harvard Summer School so I was ready for all the Why Us and whatnot, but at the beginning I was visibly anxious. Once I warmed up this was also a very nice conversation that went over the 30 minute timeframe. Overall can't complain.

**Essays**

8/10: so this comes from my counselor, me and my family so take it with a grain of salt. We all really liked my personal statement, I spent a lot crafting it and perfecting for my Common App after the QB match round. As for the supps, some I spent more time on (Harvard, Stanford, MIT) some I kinda rushed (Duke \*cough \*cough) so it kinda varies by college in terms of quality.

LOR 3: 11/10, School head, let me read it. Was very sweet. He called me one of the most impressive students they’ve had at the entire school during his entire career, and he said I was going to be a game changer at whatever college I entered. Love them as well!

UPenn: 7/10 talked for an hour and a half. Had a wonderful conversation, but probably didn’t leave much of an impression.

**Reflection:**

Outside of a family tragedy during my sophomore year, I had an amazing time during highschool. Aiming to get into top schools made me come out of my shell in Freshman year, turned me into an extrovert, and made me explore what I was interested in.

I couldn’t be more happy with the amazing people I’ve met and the cool things I’ve gotten the opportunity to do. While it was undoubtedly extremely difficult, I am very happy I went through the process.  I’ve grown into a completely different person from who I was when I was younger. I’ve become more optimistic, more empathic, and more in control of my destiny.

Even if I hadn’t gotten into my top choices, I would have been extremely happy with my experience!

Edit: I’m with family rn, I promise I’ll answer all the questions I have later 😭

Not too outstanding. Kinda forgot to ask until it was too late, so had to pick a few random teachers. Physics teacher probably wrote a great one, but my APUSH teacher forgot who I was when I went to thank her.

**Interviews**

Princeton: Talked about my internship a lot, since he also has to do with oil and gas. Got a little into our life philosophy and favorite foods.

Stanford: Interviewer was nice :)

**Essays**

Wrote about how I wanted to have an open mind and try everything (attempted to rationalize my ECs being all over the place). Didn't really want to or feel like writing about the things going on in my family, so I just picked something mundane.

It only takes one!!! I've been mentally preparing to commit to CC for a while, so I feel blessed. My life LITERALLY changed last Friday.

This college admissions process has been one of the lowest, most emotionally draining experiences I’ve ever gone through, so I honestly feel relieved it’s over. I really should’ve applied to more targets; I just went in feeling cocky and sure that id get into at least one UC (MISTAKE!). I fell into the trap of only applying to prestigious schools, thinking their name alone would guarantee happiness and a meaningful college experience. So with that, please, please, please do research! Admissions are so random that you could do everything right and still get rejected. I so wish you all the best of luck. 

My best advice is to start early, build a narrative, be genuine, and have fun writing! Feel free to reach out with any questions.

**Essays**

My main personal essay was about learning to cook for myself after going vegetarian (but more complicated than that and tying it into the rest of life and my future and whatever, as personal statements do). I felt like I cooked. My AP Lit teacher said I cooked too, so that gives me a little proof. I felt like I did good on my supps, too, but I didn't get any human feedback to back me up so they could've been terrible for all I know lol.

**Additional Information:**

Struggled with depression and slacked off freshman/sophomore year, then recovered and got straight A's for junior/senior year, which is why the gpa is lower than most internet ivy-loving admissions-obsessed teenagers. 
If anyone is in a similar boat, and sad because they probably won't get into a single reach: Every school has good parts and bad parts. Sure, the higher-ranked schools have marginally more funding and opportunities than others, but most schools are so close in what they offer that the rankings turn into an arbitrary prestige contest. If you're the type of person to hone in on a school's low ranking and let it make you miserable, then you're gonna find tons of tiny things to be miserable about even if you do end up at a T10. There is no perfect ideal of a school. Not saying don't shoot your shot, or that you'll hate going to Harvard, but instead of focusing on how much you hate your safeties/targets for what they lack, find things you love about them (and trust me, there's plenty to love).

Essay:
For as long as I can remember, the concept of self-reliance has been my most steadfast companion. I was in the fifth grade when my mother started working evening shifts, returning home only after midnight. With my dad being a distant figure in my life, I found myself pushed into a role that most children my age could hardly imagine. I had to grow up quickly, learning to navigate the responsibilities of adulthood while still in my formative years. 
Each morning, I would jolt up to the sound of my alarm. I would get ready and prepare myself a quick breakfast, often a simple bowl of cereal, and set myself off to school. There was no one to ensure I was on time or even to see me off with a hug. At the age of 14, my responsibilities multiplied when I started working. After school, I would board another bus to get to my job, where I worked between 30 to 40 hours a week. The money I earned was essential, covering my food, car expenses, school supplies, and hygiene products. With my mom working late, these were necessities I had to manage on my own.
Managing work and school became a balancing act I performed daily. My evenings were spent doing homework without any assistance, cleaning the house, and cooking my meals. I didn't have the luxury of parental guidance or support so I learned to be self-reliant. This self-sufficiency became my greatest strength. I understood that my future depended on my efforts and dedication. There was no safety net, no fallback option if I failed. 
Despite these challenges, I refused to let my circumstances define me. I took my academics and passions seriously, knowing they were my ticket to a better life. My education became my priority. I would often stay up late to study after working long hours. My situation, though difficult, motivated me to push myself to the limit and strive for excellence in everything I did. My hard work paid off when I earned top grades in my classes and received recognition for my academic achievements.
Raising myself wasn’t just about survival, it was about thriving against the odds. It required maturity beyond my years and a level of responsibility that few of my peers could comprehend. While they enjoyed the carefree moments of adolescence, I was budgeting my earnings and planning my future. 
As I look back on those years, I am grateful for all I learned. I recognize that my challenges have been my greatest teachers. My journey was not an easy one, but it was mine. I carry with me the lessons of self-reliance, perseverance, and resilience that I learned during those formative years. My experience, though arduous, shaped my character and prepared me for the rigors of adulthood. I have already proven to myself that I can succeed on my own so I am not daunted by the road ahead, instead, I approach it with a sense of optimism and confidence.

**Additional Information:**

I'm very grateful to get a second chance at an exceptional CS school, especially because my Freshman grades were not the best. I had hearing issues, and I fixed them through lipreading, but with COVID, people started wearing masks and each classroom had a loud air filter, so I struggled. I was scared to ask for help because I thought I would be looked down on, which I realize now is not the case. 

I think if my grades were better I would have a good shot at my reaches, especially because my school is an uber feeder and my friends and people I know with ECs on a similar level were able to get into their reaches, and they had better grades than me. I don't have anyone to blame but myself, but it's something I have thought about. I am looking forward to UW especially because I will be going with a friend, so at the end of the day I am happy with my choice.

**Reflection**

This isn't what I expected at all. On one hand, there were definitely some disappointments (such as my Harvey Mudd rejection) and some times when everything was looking down. On the other hand, getting into Cornell was not even a possibility on my radar when I applied and was the biggest surprise/highest point of this whole process. I'm not committed anywhere yet, but I feel incredibly happy to have all of these choices.

I would say that the best decision that I made was finding schools that I loved in all of the ranges of selectivity. Even though I applied to some T20s and highly-competitive schools, it made the process feel better when you know that you have safeties and targets where you know that you would be happy. This is something that I almost didn't do, being swept away by the flood of rankings and acceptance rates, but it made rejections and long waits infinitely more bearable.

Looking at it data-wise, I have come to realize that I did pretty much no STEM ECs in high school while applying to some very competitive STEM programs, and this was probably a weak spot. However, I wouldn't change anything if I could do this again. I enjoyed every extracurricular that I participated in, and I picked all of them because I wanted to participate.

**Final comments**:

My biggest regret is not competing more. I started competition math in 9th grade and never did a piano competition. I'd say I'm a more qualified musician than a mathematician, but I didn't have any of the tools or connections to do anything with all of the time I put into my composing/playing when it actually mattered. I spent a great deal of time on piano throughout high school and had nothing to show for it.

I also would've put more time into summer programs. I didn't apply to any summer math programs since I preferred to work with kids and teach them math, but that's hard to quantify on an application. If I could do this all over again, I would've done one of two things: either fully apply as a social studies major for education (I noticed the humanities kids from my school did really well, STEM didn't), or just axe all of the education stuff and go for pure pure pure math.

**Letters of Recommendation**

My relationships with my teachers is really good I would say:

English Teacher: 9.5/10.. She is basically like a family member to me and she likes me alot and being an english teacher the LOR was absolutely insane..

Mathematics Teacher: 8/10.. Im also her favourite student so im guessing the LOR would be pretty good

Computer Teacher: 7/10.. Im not her favourite student but she likes me a lot asw so same thing

I had a few other LOR from extracuricullars and stuff asw id say around 8/10 avg

**Interviews**

I had a few interviews.. from Dartmouth, Rice, and MIT

Dartmouth one was alright.. im trash at interviews but the interviewer was very supportive so that was pretty nice.

MIT: This one was great we talked for 50-60 mins and my extracurriculars resonated w interviewer asw (she had history of breast cancer in the family) so she said she'd give me a good recommendation but she told me not to hold high hopes since MIT hasnt taken anyone from MENA in the past 4 years

Rice: Absolutely trashed this one lol... my interviewer was a free radical and started asking me about the labour conditions in my country which I described as ""pleasant"".. otherwise it was still not too good

**Essays**

My college specific essays were to the point, and not that creative..

but my comonapp main 650 word essay is what made me stand out imo... when I was young I lost my mother due to cancer so because of that I created like a journey out of it.. and it basically brought my whole application together

One in particular has a similar application but with lower academic/ec achievements, yet received at least some acceptances. Another student I know (we worked on projects for a class) was academically strong and maintained good grades, though he didn’t have many standout extracurricular achievements.

**Awards/Honors**
i think i submitted that im an ap scholar with distinction but I cant verify that

**Letters of Recommendation**

1st - apush teacher who I really liked, also wrote a couple of letter of recs for me before. I think she did a good job but mostly stuck to the template 7/10

2nd - Spanish teacher, i have a really good relationship with him. He wrote a very good and praising rec letter 9/10

3rd - my honors english teacher. we have a good relationship but i only had one class with her. she offered to write me one so i used it. It was very likely very good 7/10

**Interviews**

i didnt have an interview for any of the colleges but i did have one for a scholarship and all I can say is be incredibly friendly and do research before the interview so you are prepared

**Essays**

Talked about how I created a language and how it helped me develop a relationship with my father. I think it was quite good and all of the feedback i got was glowing. 8/10

2. Video game development: Created a first person hack-and-slash game with advanced movement mechanics called Blade Fury. I was hella inspired by Ghost Runner when I was creating this game, so ig you could call it a free knock off. Published on steam and got 25,000 downloads.
3. Video game development: Created a first person shooter game called Endometric Void (do NOT ask why I put this as the name lmao). This was my first big game project and so its pretty unpolished. But, my friend helped in spreading it and so it got 37,000 downloads lol. It's also on Steam
4. Game Development and Design: Did 4 courses on game development provided by MSU. Got a 94%+ in each.
5. Basketball: Was in the school basketball team for 2 years. Our team was kinda cracked honestly. We won a district level tournament, came second in a state-level tournament and second in a national level tournament that was specifically made for IB schools. But basketball in India is not as developed so the competition wasn't allat.
6. Taught computer science to underpriveleged kids. Created syllabus, Instagram Posts and was actively involved in both online and offline classes.
7. Trinity Grade 4 Rock and Pop drums. Got a Merit Certificate.
8. Created a website to publishh almost 100 3D models I created through out my high school journey. These models included cars, weapons, mechanical robots, sci-fi environments and more. 

**Awards/Honors**

*Awards are lowkey weak compared to the rest of my application and compared to the other people that I see on this forum.*

1. AP Scholar with distinction: Since I was the only person in my school taking AP exams (our counsellors did NOT recommend students to take AP exams because we were alr in IB), ig it counts for smtg.
2. Certificate of Excellence in Physics and Chemistry: Earned a grade of 7 in both my semesterss of junior year
3. Certificate of Distinction by Cambridge ICE: Got 3A\*s, 4As and 1B for my final sophomore year board exams.
4. National Cyber Olympiad (School Rank 1 in grade 10)

My awards aren't much really. I had a few inter-school programmin competitions I participated in and won but they were too minor to really include in my application. 

**Letters of Recommendation**

Math AAHL Teacher: Math has been a strong point of mine and she knows that I've been well versed in calculus since junior year. My school teaches it in 12th grade so ig that counts for smtg. Although I have no idea if my teacher uses a pre-formatted LOR or actually puts in the effort of writing it herself so idk. 7/10

Physics HL Teacher: Physics has also been a strong point of mine with active participation in labs. Ig I wasn't always the quiet kid in class so sometimes that was a good thing and other times that was a bad thing when my teacher's mood was off. 6/10

Guidance counselor: I have talked to my guidance counsellor multiple times and ig I did kinda stand out with her because my family and I often went against her advice about many things (such as registering for AP exams or writing our commonapp essay differently than what she would've wanted). But she's always told me that I have potential. Now idk if she's said that to multiple other students as well so idk.  6.5/10

**Interviews**

Literally none

**Essays**

commonapp essay was about my video game bin me right, about how it was inspired by a visit to a hopsital wherein I noticed the terrible way medical waste was managed. Other counsellors at school loved the idea because it was highlighting the social service I was doing my creating the videogame. 

supplements were okay I think. I did put a lot of effort into them writing multiple drafts. I did recylce a lot so that reduced a lot of the work load asw

**Decisions** 

*Acceptances:*

* UMass Amherst: 18,000 scholarship per year
* Virginia Tech
* University of Washington, Seattle: Got in for Pre-Sciences😭😭
* University of Wisconsin, Madison
* University of Maryland, College Park (great for cyber security honestly)
* University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (yessir, I'm waiting for the advanced selection for CS. If I don't get it, DS seems like a good option there). I'm applying for the 25k per year international LSA students scholarship there so imma keep my fingers crossed.
* King's College London (applied some through UCAS)
* Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (It's also pretty good but it's in Hong Kong so idw really go there)

*Waitlists:*

* UCSD

*Rejections:*

* UC Berkeley
* UCI (I have no idea how honestly)
* UCLA
* JHU
* Cornell
* Duke
* UPenn (Really wanted to get into this for the Digital Media Design program but whatever)
* CMU
* UChicago (Defer in ED1 -> Reject in ED2)
* UIUC
* Georgia Tech
* Purdue (Defer in EA -> Reject in RD. Kinda wanted this to come through asw, but pretty great applicants from my school got rejected from here asw so idk)
* UT Austin (Defer in EA -> Reject in RD)
* Yale
* Cambridge (this one is the worst lmao. I pulled up to the exam center with an expired passport😭. I was sent right back to home lol and my application was unsucessful lol. I did prepare my ass off for this, did like each past paper was there but whatever)
* ICL: (Met the grade requirement, but messed up my second TMUA attempt that I took in Jan, got a 4.7 bruh)

Well, looking at the list of rejections, I know I could've done better somewhere, such as having a better SAT score, better grades, maybe one more cracked activity, better essays and stuff like that. I do have a lot of regrets with where I could've and should've spent more time in because somewhere along the way I did loose my focus on admissions and in my heart I know I have the capability of doing muc better. 

Anyways, the saving grace for me is UMich. I'm pretty glad I got it, not only because its a pretty great CS/DS school with a goated reputation but also because my brother is also there (CS at LSA lol). I was also considering UW, taking Pre-Sciences in the first year and try my luck at tranferring to ACMS or ECE because I have family near Seattle but yeah. UMich is the way for me to go.

**Some observations I had with other applicants for CS at my school**

My school is pretty new and it has never had an Ivy acceptance before. My batch of students is still pretty cracked tho, acceptances from UCLA, UIUC, NYU Stern, Purdue, University of Edinburgh, UCL, Bocconi, UChicago, JHU and many more, so I wouldn't say the school itself is bad, it just hasn't had top-tier acceptances in the past. 

Now, as far CS: in my school there were extremely few CS applicants. Most of the STEM kids applied for some other sorta engineering such as mechanical, electrical, aerospace, etc., However, the CS applicants at school were actually cracked af: 1540 SAT, research paper publications on ML, UCB summer school, ML projects, School Ambassador, 42 or 43/45 predicted and stuff like that. People around expected many of us to get into ivies or like Top 5 for CS, but that didn't happen. In fact, the best acceptance for computer science has been to Wisconsin Madison for CS, which is a pretty decent school but not what was expected honestly. So, is this made to discourage people from applying for CS? A little bit, because the competition has skyrocketed HEAVILY for CS. But also from browsing this subReddit and reading a bunch, I've realised that people, with great stats don't get accepted to top colleges that they would've expected because they fall under the category of 'boring cracked stats kids'. What I have realised is that colleges admire quirky kids (not as an insult ofc, but as a differentiating factor) that somehow are able to separate themselves from other kids. One of my friends, for example, wrote her commonapp essay on ice cream and her supplementals on Barbie dolls because her stats and activities spoke for themselves. She got into Imperial College London, UCLA, JHU for biology which is pretty amazing honestly. 

So my advice for aspiring kids who wanna make T20 or T10 in whatever field they go to:

1) Stats are obviously important because for top-tier schools, it is like an unspoken prerequisite. So, don't slack off on that. Proritize grades (especially in subjects that are related to your chosen field), activites that are related to your field (even better if they serve some sort of community purpose), etc.,

2) Be around people that enhance your personality and enhance your ability to express: This is rather an unspoken point that I've seen but I feel that if you're around people that can make your personality visibly better and make you more expressive and more creative, that's always a plus because their influence goes beyond how well you can write essays and impress AOs.

3) Be balanced and focused: I see people that trynna dip their toes into everything. I say it's okay to explore but in doing so, you'll not exactly get unbelievably great at those things. Instead have a specific focus in mind (for me it was game development, but in retrospect, I also went overboard with it).

4) Do what you enjoy because applications then don't seem like a burden anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jr4org/indian_student_applying_for_cs/,1743745510,1510,,3.867423997,South Asian,"UMass Amherst: 18,000 scholarship per year, Virginia Tech, University of Washington, Seattle: Got in for Pre-Sciences😭😭, University of Wisconsin, Madison, University of Maryland, College Park (great for cyber security honestly), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (yessir, I'm waiting for the advanced selection for CS.

1jr08db,Latinasian girl SAVED by miracle acceptance :3,"NOTE: I maxed the 20 school limit on my Common App because my biggest problem was THE AID. My family is middle-upper class in Latin America in a way that makes us look well off on paper (CSS profile 😐), but living in an expensive city with expensive schools makes finances tight. My comfortable EFC was 20k-ish with a MAX of 30k which was much tighter on our budget. Anything beyond, we'd need loans, which I wanted to avoid at all costs.

**Academics:**

* GPA (UW/W): 4.0UW, school doesn't do weighted
* Rank (or percentile): 1/104
* Senior Year Course Load: Took the IB diploma (6 classes plus TOK/EE - HL: aa math, physics, english A langlit)

* Prefect / student government
* no more bc doxxing :P

**Essays**

Got my school counselor to check over CA personal statement and supps, we were very happy with how they turned out in the end. I'd say my personal statement was my best essay, very personal experiences tied to lessons learned (lol). I lowkey loved writing SOME essays, but I do think they became a little repetitive after writing a good 40+ supplements.

(My coolest essays were definitely my BU ones, since I thought there was no way in hell I was getting the scholarship, so might as well write about whatever I wanted lol)

**Letters of recommendation:** IB Physics teacher wrote my 1st LOR - I worked with her for all my EE research (and 2 years of IB), I wasn't the top student in our class, but a genuine tryhard (in a good way hopefully haha 🥲). She really liked my EE project and saw my Breakthrough video submission, so I think she had the most complete view of me as a STEM student.

English teacher (of 3+ years) wrote my other LOR - described me as one of the best students he'd had while teaching at my school when I asked him to write it. I did not get to look at either letter, but I think they were pretty solid.

**Interviews**

Princeton, Dartmouth. I really hit it off with my Princeton interviewer (super duper sweet latina law student that did her pregrad there) and we talked for over an hour, but I know that interviews are not prescreened so idk how much that helped my case lol. For Dartmouth I didn't connect with my interviewer that much, so it didn't go as well as my Princeton one.

**Demonstrated Interest**

I didn’t visit/tour any of my schools (intl things lol), and didn't sign up for mailing lists but still got their emails I guess. I did email the BU regional Assistant AO a lot though, since I didn't know anything about the scholarship I was applying to beforehand.

4. Most Outstanding musician at my school :))) (3 times, once each year)
5. CA Boys & Girls State (i didn't win a big position BUT i had a lot of fun, recommend juniors to go)

**Letters of Recommendation**

Note: service academies require my 11 or 12 grade english and 11 or 12 grade math teachers to write me a recommendation letter, so i was technically limited to 4 people i could ask. luckily the teachers I was planning to ask qualified to write me a letter under SA (service academy) guidelines. also i don't want to rate out of 10 when i haven't seen their letters so i wont.

AP Lang teacher: taught me in 11th grade. ended quarter 1 with a D in her class LOL. went in for extra help and got it up to an A- by the end of the fall semester (school only shows semester grades and counts those for gpa etc.) She is notorious for cooking on letters, im sure it was great

AP Calculus teacher: taught me in 8th grade, teaching algebra. now is teaching me calculus. Gave me my only ever B in 8th grade (i blame covid and that fact that she is a crazy hard teacher). i think she likes me, but she would hang the letter over my head sometimes when i didn't turn in my hw lol. letter was probably good as well.

guidance counselor: literally my top dawg, super helpful and always available to talk. i did read her letter, it was pretty good. maybe not as focused on her own experiences with me and more talking about my achievements, but it was fine, she wasn't recommending against me. if i had to rate this one, probably a 6.5/10

**Interviews**

Yale: pretty chill music grad student. connected over music and the world series. helped that she knows my dad

Dartmouth: bro i loved this guy, older gentleman who i think is a retired doctor. he lives on a farm now with horses. bro is chill af.

Received no other interviews, rip

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Personal statement about my faith and a family camp we go to. i thought it was pretty bad, kind of rushed, but summed up my character well enough.

supplements were all pretty rushed,  i procrastinated a lot.

a. formula 1: wrote about f1, though i've never been to an inperson race or did anything crazy with it. i just like watching and reading about the technical side of f1

b. asian conference I mentioned in my activities (number 10) and becoming more comfortable with my asian heritage

c. music and how i like music

d. work i did with activity 7 (volunteering and homelessness)

probably some more but i forgot them.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* SJSU
* UC Davis
* UCLA
* US Air Force Academy (Letter of Asssurance, basically a likely letter for service academies)
* US Naval Academy
* University of the Pacific
* Cornell
* Swarthmore
* Yale
* Stanford

*Waitlists:*

* Cal Poly SLO
* UC Irvine
* Rochester Institute of Technology (waitlist --> accepted alt. major)
* Carnegie Mellon
* WashU in St. Loius

*Rejections:*

* UC Berkeley
* Harvey Mudd
* Dartmouth
* Northwestern (Dual-degree music and engineering)
* Johns Hopkins
* UPenn

**Additional Information:**

I submitted an arts portfolio at all schools which allowed me to. I believe they were: Swarthmore, Cornell, Yale, Stanford. Now I'm noticing a correlation between acceptances and arts portfolio...

Also, I submitted Northwestern prescreening for music degree and did an audition there.

**Summary**

*I feel very lucky to have the options I do. Of course, I do have legacy at Yale, which helped me. I also applied for the NROTC scholarship, and personnel at Cornell advocated for me in their admissions process, which might have boosted me. For those reasons I felt like even though I did work hard, I got in because of some added bonus. However, Stanford has alleviated those feelings for me and I now feel like I actually did have some good stuff in my essays or something.*

*Also, I would like to point out that I was waitlisted to Cal Poly SLO while being admitted to Stanford and Yale. This college application process is actually so random, make it make sense lol.*

**Advice for juniors and underclassmen:**

1. Enjoy your life. I feel like I just tried to take classes I liked (which were a lot of AP classes) and focus on music, which I love doing. I did try a little bit in some areas, but I don't think I was full-on grinding during high school, just doing opportunities that were presented to me. I was worried during the college app process that I wouldn't get admitted based on my lack of engineering ECs bc i put mech e as my preferred major, but it turned out fine.
2. i would highly recommend looking into the service academies. they aren't for everyone, and even now i'm starting to lean against them as the best option for me, but the thing about all military adjacent stuff is that they do A LOT of interviews. my first interview for naval academy was CRAP, like it went so badly that my interviewer said he would call later and to prepare better. thankfully he showed mercy and helped me with my interview skills a bunch. i feel like i crushed the rest of my interviews due to my military academy/NROTC interview experiences.
3. take time to reflect. i think if i spent some more time over the summer chilling out and thinking about what is important to me i would have figured out sooner a. what i want to do in college, b. what colleges i would like to attend, and c. what i would write about in essays. basically just dont procrastinate lol.

EDIT: Currently deciding between Yale and Stanford. As I commented below, ""USNA was my first-choice school for most of this year. However, after visiting and shadowing a plebe, and in light of current political events, I'm leaning more and more away from it."" Additionally, hoping to do NROTC at the school I end up choosing.

1jqyjx6,USAMO Qual + Valedictorian get VERY surprising results.,"**Demographics**

Male

White (Hungarian-American; Both parents are immigrants from Hungary)

New Hampshire, USA

Upper-Middle Class (\~250k household income)

Small public high school in southern New Hampshire

* Hooks (N/A. Not legacy or first-gen unfortunately. Unless divorced parents counts?):

**Intended Major(s)**: Mathematics. With the exception of CS for UMass Amherst and CS + Math for UIUC.

I made a mistake applying for CS some places lol I've realized more recently that I want to stick to just math.

**Academics**

GPA: 4.91/5.33 W. School counts A+ as 4.33 unweighted. Would be 4.0 UW on a normal scale.

Rank: 1/95

17 APs. All 5s (so far)

Senior year: 8 APs. One of which is also dual enrollment at a local CC. Doing some test only exams as well. 8 is the number of exams, not classes.

Note on rigor: my schedule was very unusual since I had persistent scheduling conflicts, so I used a local online school a lot, did Calc AB (school required it) but took the BC exam instead, and took 10.5 credits in Sophomore year lol. Had very nice rigor progression with mostly regular/honors freshman year, honors/AP sophomore year, and AP Junior and Senior. I'm pretty sure I am taking more APs than my school offers. (due to online school and test only)

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

SAT I: 1560 (760RW, 800M). Obviously reported this at all schools.

No other standardized tests besides APs, which I have gotten all 5s on so far.

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

Founder and captain of school's math team (11th and 12th grade)

Lead problem writer for a mock AIME posted on AoPS that had over 100 submissions. (11th)

AwesomeMath Summer Program for two summers. Passed level 3 and 4 courses.

New Hampshire Math Circle for one summer

Martial arts black belt for 11 years, including helping teach classes.

EDIT: Gotta clarify I was not a black belt for 11 years. Been doing Karate for 11 years. Got black belt in fall of 2023.

Four honors societies (NHS, Science honors society, Spanish honors society, Social studies honors society)

Class treasurer and fundraising committee in 10th grade. Helped count money and funded prom.

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. Top 10% AIME II 2023 (First ever AIME! Didn't write that tho. Got an 8.)
2. National merit semifinalist
3. Perfect score on NH State math contest
4. 2nd Place NH-Smash league as a junior.
5. 2nd place NH ARML. Hosted under realistic contest settings and timing, but unofficially due to New Hampshire budget constraints. Got a score of 7. 11th grade.

Noteworthy:

\- I can go to ARML officially this year! See you all at St. Anslem in May if you're going. NH Coach was able to convince ARML to open an official location nearby, since we couldn't afford transportation anywhere else.

\- You may be noticing that USAMO is in the title but not here. This is because I qualifier senior year and sent it in a letter of senior year accomplishments, which I will now explain.

**Letter of senior year accomplishments**

Schools I sent this to have an asterisk afterward, since some released results before USAMO cutoffs were out, or did not accept updates. Information includes:

\- USAMO Qualification, with a score of 12 on AIME I 2025. and 132 on both AMC 12s.

\- 1st place in NH-Smash league as a senior.

\- Nominated as a presidential scholar candidate by the U.S. department of education

\- Accepted to Nontrivial Foundation's winter research cohort.

**Letters of Recommendation**

\- Counselor Rec: No clue how strong it was. Knew her all four years and would often come in with lists of questions and just ask. Asked at the end of Junior year.

\- Social Studies Teacher: Probably reasonably strong. Was my social studies teacher in Freshman and now Senior year, and my advisor for all four years of high school. Asked at the end of Junior year.

\- NH Math Team Coach (Supplamental rec:). Asked in August before senior year. Don't know how strong it is. He knew me since I was a sophomore, when I started doing competition math.

\- High school math teacher: Probably my strongest one. I had the same math teacher's classes for all four years of high school, was one of the advisors of the math team I founded, and we were very close. I didn't know while applying for college, but while applying for scholarships I got to read the essay. It was very well written and mentioned some activities that I didn't write as an EC (and some that I did). Including:

\- Wrote a full AP Calculus AB mock exam in my junior year. Forgot I did this while applying. I just did it for fun.

\- Helped teach AP Calculus BC to 3 other students, since my school otherwise wouldn't have had enough people to run the class and it ran at the same time as Calculus AB. I thought this was more of an academics thing and couldn't write this as an EC. Maybe I was wrong and almost fumbled my app idk.

**Interviews**

\- MIT: 8/10. I didn't get stuck on any questions but most of the interview was me asking the interviewer questions, and I feel like I didn't get to express a whole lot. He linked how I mentioned messing around with ChatGPT for fun by asking it to write a random essay, then giving it that same essay and asking it to explain why it could not possibly by AI generated, just to see how well AI can lie.

\- Dartmouth: 10/10. This one went VERY well. I was able to use everything I had in my arsenal pretty much exactly once, didn't really struggle with any questions, and got to express myself very well. My school didn't host the AMC and I took it at the school where my interviewer graduated, so we both knew the math teacher there. Best interview performance of my life. I know it went well because my interviewer offered to help tour parts of campus that weren't included in the usual tour (I mentioned during the interview that I was visiting Dartmouth soon.)

\- Yale: 6/10. Wasn't anything bad, but the order the questions were asked in had me tripping over my own shoelaces and kind of using the same information multiple times. Felt like I didn't do bad, but didn't stand out.

\- UPenn: 5/10. This one wasn't called an interview official and was called like an alumni conversation or something. Did this over phone instead of zoom, and kept having issues with my interviewer not being able to make out what I said due to the poor audio quality. My actual performance was similar to Yale, but I was cutoff sometimes and I didn't know if it was because of the poor audio quality or because I was talking too much idk I felt like I wasn't talking that much.

**Essays**

Personal statement: My Junior year English teacher is the GOAT and had a unit dedicated to having us write our essays as part of English class. I had a kind of oddball topic and talked about hiking, my relation to nature, and how it kind of relates to escaping/refueling for maximum productivity, since this was not reflected elsewhere in my app. Got this reviewed by some teachers and overall felt it was mid-good. I didn't use ChatGPT to assist while making it, but after submitting my apps I asked it to rate my personal statement and it said 80/100. I'm not the best writer style-wise I'm a math kid lol.

Supplementals: This is where I messed up. I didn't know too much about the college application process since I didn't really have anyone I could regularly talk to about it. I ended up doing supplementals for 15 schools within like a week. Partly due to my lack of process knowledge and partly just from ordinary procrastination. Didn't get these reviewed by anyone besides myself or use any tools besides google docs spelling and grammar check lol.

I talked about Martial Arts and the lessons in optimism it taught me a lot, but I was careful not to repeat any topic twice per college. I feel like I was particularly creative with my brown university 3 words to describe yourself supplemental and said  ""Ponder, Ding, Boom."" to try to stand out a bit.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

EA:

Applied to some safeties. Applied to 11 schools, mostly random nearby safety schools cause they had no app fee, I didn't know common-app had a 20 college limit, and for some reason I thought I might get rejected from UNH. Swept all safeties. Notable acceptance (ones I care about most) include:

UNH (Hamel scholars program + $$$$$), and RPI ($$$ + Medalist)

RD:

Recall that \* means they got and accepted an email or pdf (I think these are called LOCI?) detailing senior year accomplishments

**Additional Information:**

I was a schoolhouse Tutor as well for SAT Math but only MIT had a spot to put this. Didn't know about these, so I didn't do the peer rec for Dartmouth or video for Brown oops.

My advice: Start EVERYTHING Early. College list? Junior year. Recs? Junior year. Essays? Soon as prompts come out. I missed out on so many opportunities and optional requirements just because I didn't know about them and majorly messed up so many things when I should have known better. My performance on the actual app process was awful and I almost sold four years of hard work over a few months of confusion. Is it fair? Absolutely Not. It is true? Yes. I am so thankful for the teachers at my school who I mentioned in this post. Also make a spreadsheet of places you applied including links to the portal.

**Essays:**

Essays shed some light onto my business and other ECs. According to a current UPenn M&T student that’s been asked to review essays for transfer students this year, my Penn essays read like other admitted student essays.

I talked about my experience innovating in cryptocurrency miners, transforming them from this inaccessible and technical beast into something that’s accessible by everyone. I articulated upon making my products plug-and-play, something that nobody else thought of doing. This resulted in a drastic increase in sales, and I connected it to the importance of UX alongside engineering, and how business and engineering go hand-in-hand to innovate. I later mention how I want to apply this in the semiconductor industry, creating cheap and accessible semiconductor fabrication equipment.

**Letters of Recommendation:**

* Math Teacher 9/10
   * I loved calc AB, and my teacher really does believe that students can be successful with different methods, and that everyone deserves to learn and succeed. I think I asked her to highlight that I went in during my spare time so I could learn more/understand better with different instructors. Her husband was a math teacher, she brought in retired math teachers, and sometimes her son (math major at UW) would come in to talk to us about the concepts in class and I think those different perspectives helped a lot. I love her dearly but she does not have “Bedtime” as a concept, so sometimes you can see the canvas notification on a Thursday morning (I'm talking 2 am), just because she’s grading. She really needs sleep lol. 
* AP seminar and lang Teacher 6/10
   * I did not like this guy. I’m just grateful that he wrote one for me because I 
      1. Didn’t like the work I did in the classes
      2.  Didn’t like the things we learned in the classes
   * I don't even know why I took AP lang. 
   * I was not locked in for that class. 
* Nursing professors 9.5/10
   * OMG. I loved all my instructors for that class (there were like 4 of them). I got one from my lecturer and one from the clinicals and labs professor. One middle aged white guy and one Filipina auntie, and they were the best duo. Were classes anywhere between 9-12 hours long? Yes. Was there loud construction outside the building and in nearby neighborhoods? Yes. Did I like that class experience? ABSOLUTELY, and iirc I asked them to write about my ambition and willingness to learn.
* Counselor 9/10
   * Perks of living near your counselor and also knowing her family is that she likes me a lot. I can also say that I try my best to make my schoolwork and extracurriculars easy on her, so whenever she checks in, I try to be friendly and do most of the work for her (we are understaffed and I feel very bad). 

**Essay:**

* Main Essay (7.75/10)- Certainly weren’t the greatest essays to ever be written. I had three  “stock” main essays that I wrote over the summer, one was about my lifelong worship of comics and their storytelling impact on my life, One is about erasure of my native language and being indigenous to a specific region/ethnic group, and one is about being a lifelong “why?” kid. Overall, I think that they, at minimum, showed the colleges who I am and what I’m passionate about, and why I choose to keep empathy and logic at equal weights within my life, and I'm happy with how it turned out. 
* Supplementals- I wrote a lot about the dead and dying lmao (goth girl go figure), and about half of that was related to CNA experiences. I actually did put in a lot of effort into these, mostly because I wasn’t writing the main essays at the same time. Surprisingly, only mentioned my disability once (UToronto)

**Additional Information:**

Well this was a very stressful process and I hope UW Seattle comes through so I don’t ever have to do this again. I was really happy to see 0 rejections, but now the anxiety is prolonged after seeing three of my top schools waitlist me. Very surprising to see UW waitlist so many people, and since they’re my #1 school, it’ll probably be local community college so that I can transfer in after a year or so (Halfway to the AA already). Pitt only accepts \~300 or so people into their nursing program, and I submitted my app kind of late so that wasn’t really a surprise.

1. Space Camp 

2. Volunteering at a local COVID-19 memorial (mainly since my aunt and grandmother passed away from COVID): Did a lot of yard work since it was on a farm. Helped organize events and clean up afterwards. Really bonded with other people that lost their family which was great. 

3. Volunteering at a local assisted living center (aunt lived their before she passed away): Did a lot of event planning and helped connect with the people their to comfort them.

4. Volunteer at my local library: helped sort books, clean, organize events, etc.

6. TSA (Technology Student Association): Worked with teammates to create a biodegradable scaffold for a biotechnology design to assess the topic of tissue engineering. We also created a small, biofiltration system that uses the layers in plant roots and nitrogen-fixing bacteria to filter nitrogen out of water (got these ideas off of chatgpt lol and made them work somehow). We used these and participated in local competitions.

7. NHS: Tutored, organized events, helped with the induction ceremony, etc.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Biology and Authentic STEM Research (class I took sophomore year) teacher (8/10): ASR was a very interesting class. I average like a 95 and presented research at a symposium. This year, I talk to him way more. Went to office hours a lot and constantly asks questions about bio. 

AP Physics C Mechanics and APES teacher (7/10): He said he highlighted the fact that I grew from junior year to senior year (junior year was rough) exponentially. I have a very good relationship with him. 

Algebra 2 teacher (4-5/10): I barely know her. I  got an 100 in her class but I never talked sophomore year and only had a couple interactions with her. Honestly ran out of people to ask. 

Guidance Counselor (9-10/10): She knows me the most out of any faculty in my school. I talked to her throughout junior year a lot because of my mental health and she was a lot of help. She's seen me grow a lot in a year.

**Essays**

My personal essay was about how my deep passion for space basically saved me from being alone by going to space camp and finding my people, ultimately creating new relationships that will forever resonate with me (I won't lie, I feel as though it's very basic but I got a Harvard grad to review it and they like it). 

Supplemental essays were rushed for most of the early RD deadline schools. All of the others that were due after or on Jan 1st were to me amazing. Got an english teacher to review them and she said she loved them.

Not gonna lie I totally understand my rejections but UMN waitlist is crazy. I just wanna throw it out there but I hate how I have to clutch my grades in the one yesr that is seen as the least important for college apps. Like I got a 4.57 W GPA first semester and I wish I committed myself way earlier. I' m  having a hard time being happy lol. I know a lot of high school kids say this but I had a lot of mental health issues that would not be good to put on common app so they just think I was either lazy or stupid junior year (for reference I had a 2.92 W GPA junior year). My guidance counselor recommended me a place for therapy but like most males today I didn't think I needed it. I still do think I didn't need it because in the end I found myself but it's unfortunate that it had to take a while. Honsetly surpirsed I got into Rutgers, Penn State UP, but especially Denison. I really wish I did good enough for merit at CU Boulder bc that's my favorite school and best for my major(s) but unfortunately not. 72/year and needing to go to grad school does not mix well. To me, Rutgers is expensive, like 32.4/year is soooo much. My parents say it's fine but I can't help but feel guilty for it though. The fact that it's my cheapest school is crazy though, like why can't a school be under 30k 😭

**Extracurriculars**: was briefly president of chess club and then resigned; composed music in my spare time and made some money off of it; and volunteered for my local socialist party. 

**Essays/LOR:** I didn't bother with letters of recommendation, though teachers usually like me. My essay was about the fear of forgetting, my being a contributor to Wikipedia, and the love of reading, but the vast majority of Canadian schools don't take personal essays, so it's largely tangential. I'm not a big fan of the genre to begin with, so whenever a school took writing samples I'd submit something else instead.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Neuroscience instructor (?/10) - Not sure how to assign a number to these. She knows me pretty well, since she sponsors the Neuroscience Club and chaperoned a school research trip I was on. I also took her class in Junior year and TA for it now.

Philosophy instructor (?/10) - Again, idk how to rank it. I've been going to her office hours literally every week since sophomore year, so we're pretty close. She's one of my favorite people ever.

**Interviews**

MIT - Had a fun time talking about research and stuff. Lasted an hour. Had a couple of awkward moments, but I'm just like that sometimes (unfortunately).

Princeton - Also super fun. I had a younger interviewer than for MIT (a lot closer to my age), so we vibed. Talked about the joys of Wikipedia together for like twenty minutes lol. She went over the allotted time to talk more about her experience at Princeton and answer some questions.

**Essays**

I went with the ""what are you interested in"" prompt for the Common App and wrote about time (as in the concept). I'd hope that it was okay, considering that I'm a writer.

Supplemental essays definitely varied in quality across schools lol.

I definitely expected to have less waitlists and more acceptances... I'm not quite sure how this happened tbh. I guess I presented a singular image across applications? I'm writing LOCIs rn, so I'll update if anything changes. For now, it's looking like I'm going to commit to UMass.

I even got aid from NYU. At first, they were a bit shy about giving me aid. But then, I told them that I made a mistake on the CSS profile \[which I did correct, but they didn't take the corrections into account while calculating my aid\] so that gave me a form on which I could report my correct income, and they recalculated my aid. They were only giving me like 10k in aid previously, but afterwards, they gave me like 70% aid on tution. Also, I left out some colleges which weren't major by any angle. Only Cornell and NYU were the colleges I would have gone to with aid.

Also, please note that I got into LSC, but am going to try to transfer into Stern. HOPE is never dead. And don't worry, if you are a good candidate, even need aware schools may give you some aid ;))

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

**Interviews**

Penn - 7/10, pretty standard

Rice - 4/10, my wifi was terrible at the time and she kept repeating everything I said back to me

Dartmouth - 10/10, we talked for 2 hours and dude gave me a tour of his office then offered me an internship 😭

Stanford - 8/10 pretty chill guy, we just talked about random shit - don’t even think he asked 1 question about stanford

Duke - 10/10, we got along really well as she was quite young, talked about her culture shock at Duke coming from a small asian country

Robertson Scholarship Semifinalist Interview (@Duke) - probably not great as I didn’t make it to finalist

**Essays**

Essays were all well written - did all optional essays for schools, submitted Brown video essay etc. Can't really elaborate on the content but they were all strongly personal, demonstrated strong interest and connection with the schools, and displayed a good amount of intellect/intellectual curiousity.

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. AP Lang Teacher (9/10): she's known for writing great LORs, and only for those she really loves. i got along with her so well, and always did great, and also talked to her a lot like my therapist after-school. she was going to limit how many students she wrote for this year, and told me ""don't even worry, I'll write you one no matter what"" which was a rlly good sign IMO :) ... I LOVE HER!
2. AP Computer Science Teacher (7.5/10): I'm not sure how good he writes, I didn't see the letter (don't really want to). I got along with him very well, and always talked to him more than other people did, but didn't see him much outside of class. I also had an attendance problem in his class. Nonetheless, I did a bunch of random challenge projects that took hours for fun and I think he really appreciated it (was on my brag sheet). Love him though
3. AP Calc AB Teacher (8/10): Only submitted for Caltech as I needed a math letter. Still, he was very adamant and said it would be an honor to write for me. Also had an attendance problem in his class, but always was top of the class on the tests (which he would publicly broadcast). Didn't talk to him much, but did talk to him the most out of his class. Also, he went to BOTH HARVARD AND STANFORD?! Anyways, love the guy
4. Counselor Recommendation (8.5/10): Only sung me praises. One of the only letters I actually saw. I talk to her all the time (in comparison to her other students, considering she has 350+) and give her hugs/appreciate her as much as possible. Talked about my background, family struggles, and how she's the first kid she's seen take on the courseload I have without any struggle. <3
5. Board Vice President Recommendation (9/10): Was an optional recommendation, BUT I LOVE HER SO MUCH SHE'S MY SECOND MOM. She only wrote great things, talked about my time on the board, and how much of an influence I would be on campus. Sent to all schools that accepted it.

**Interviews**

* Yale — went very well, got along great, was with current Senior, went overtime (9/10)
* MIT — went good, we got along good but nothing crazy, went slightly overtime (8/10)
* Harvard — pretty good, he sent me some information post-interview, but I did accidentally bring up controversial topics, went slightly over time (7.5/10)
* Princeton — AWESOME, got along with her great, bonded over a ton of common things in our lives, went very overtime (9.5/10)
* Stanford — went superbly, we got along and were talking overtime and had a lot in common (9/10)

**Essays**

* Main Essay (8.5/10): Was pretty good, and had a college counselor (matchlighters program) help me (who I love). She kept saying that it was great and the best of her students, but I just thought it was good, nothing crazy. Mainly talked about how I took caring for my family and used it to fuel my passion for politics + law as a force for good after coming from generational oppression at the hands of politics. Took the most time, wasn't rushed.
* Supplementals: Was mostly on my own. Wrote Harvard, MIT, Duke, and Caltech all in 30-1hr (each). Submitted Duke a couple of weeks late. Stanford, MIT and Princeton were reviewed by a counselor though, and she LOVED my Princeton one.

Princeton really surprised me, since my counselor kept saying that my application was the best for it (and a lot of the other schools accepted me with the same supplemental i originally wrote for Princeton). Something to note is that if I apply through QB, they see that I was admitted to MIT explicitly (since only MIT matches can keep using QB RD) so that might bias results.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jp9avl/the_chronic_skipper_stumbles_into_harvard_mit/,1743547773,1500,,4,Asian,"**MIT (QuestBridge NCM / EA)**, **Harvard (CommonApp RD)**, **Stanford (QB RD; likely letter/early notification 2/6)**, **Yale (QB RD; likely letter 2/7)**, **Duke (QB RD; no interview)**, **Johns Hopkins (QB RD)**, **Swarthmore (QB RD)**, **Bowdoin (QB RD;** **faculty scholar award)**, **Middlebury (QB RD)**, **University of Washington, Seattle (CommonApp RD; direct admit to CS/Allen)**",,"**Caltech (QB RD)**, **Princeton (QB RD)**, Additional Information:**",Male

* Allowed me to read the letter after submission and it was very sweet. Said I was one of the most hardworking and talented students they encountered.

* Princeton 7/10
   * Honestly didn't remember much, but I thought it was decent and reflected my character. Lasted about an hour.
* MIT 7.5/10

* Stanford 8/10
   * Very challenging interviewer, older person and had experience interviewing employees. Thought I did well, but most of the questions I could answered with only answer with one of my ecs, so didn't reflect my extracurriculars well. Lasted 1.5 hours
* Duke 7/10
   * Younger person, only asked me 2 or 3 questions, but we shared the same interests/major. Lasted a little under an hour.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I felt my common app essay was 9/10, went with a montage approach and linked ecs with my character traits and values in making others happy and spreading positivity.

\*\*\*I feel a major aspect of my essays was that they showed I was a kind person and were genuine. Someone who read it for me even said it had soul.

Wowzers! Safe to say I was very shocked opening my decisions. If you told me six months ago I would get into 3 of the T5 colleges and the YPM of HYSPM, I would've thought you were crazy. Honestly, at the beginning of the cycle, I wasn't going to apply to some of these top schools and instead, more T25s. After getting Yale though, I decided to shoot my shot! Some important notes:

* Yes, these are my ecs, I didn't do any research, write papers, participate in high competitive comps, have personal projects, etc.
* I thought about applying to these colleges in my freshman year, but didn't make it my goal. I tried to semi-enjoy high school and get good grades
* I never thought about doing stats/math until my junior year, hence the lack of stem ecs
* I centered my essays around my soft skills instead of my stem skills like leadership and communication to reflect my extracurriculars
* My first two extracurriculars (the gov ones), were not competitive! Very easy to get in since lack of applicants and rural area for me, that's why I think my ecs are unimpressive.
* Most if not all of my extracurriculars were not huge time commitments, mostly casual
* I think the reason I got into T5 colleges were because of my essays, letter of recommendations, and honestly, my location cause colleges love \*diversity\*

My advice to anybody who wants to shoot their shot:

* Apply! You'll never get in unless you do
   * But don't make that college your entire life, fall in love with your safeties!
   * If your rural and feel your ecs are mid, still try and apply because you might be a target population!
* Take advantage of every opportunity you get regardless of rural, suburban, or urban areas!
   * I tried to take the ecs that would develop my soft skills the most and the best at the moment
* Be yourself!!!!!
   * Essays are a reflection of YOU so make sure they sound genuine. While I don't think I had the best, most perfect essays, I did think they were real and showed my character
   * I believe many students fall in the mistake of bragging or worse, sounding like robots trying to  reveal their resume to apply to these schools

That's my college results! I'm leaning more towards MIT at the moment, but we'll see when my other financial aid letters come out!

1jp703w,A look back a decade later (2016 results),"I have no idea why but this subreddit was recommended to me. Reading all of these posts and stories made me wonder how on earth I got into where I did a decade ago. I was an oddball personality student that slacked upwards to success in class and only really gave 100% effort in my main EC (debate).

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian (Indian)
* Residence: Texas
* Income Bracket: Upper middle class
* Type of School: Very large public (well regarded in-state, 1/3rd of our graduating class ended up at UT Austin or Texas A&M)
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None

**Intended Major(s)**: Economics and Statistics. I figured this out thanks to my sophomore-year AP Stats teacher who made a big impact on me and I kept in touch with in college.

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 4.0/don't remember weighted \[my school had this weird system where they just tacked on a multiplier if you took an honors or AP course\]
* Rank (or percentile): 42/\~700 \[at the time, this was good enough for auto-admission to UT Austin\]
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 7 honors, 17 AP courses
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Physics C, AP Human Geography, AP Art History, AP Macroeconomics (1 semester), AP Government (1 semester), AP English Lit, Debate
   * Special math course that our school arranged at the last minute for 30 of us since the district required everyone to take a math course every year and they didn't have a course after AP Calculus BC previously.

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT I: 2280/2400 (single test, don't remember splits)
* ACT: 32 (this was offered randomly in-school one day)
* SAT II: Math II (750), World History (740)
* AP/IB: Art History (5), Calculus AB (5), Calculus BC (5), Chemistry (4), Computer Science (5), English Language (5), English Literature (5), Government (5), Human Geography (5), Macroeconomics (5), Physics 1 (5), Physics 2 (3), Physics C: Mechanics (4), Physics C: E&M (3), Statistics (5), US History (5), World History (5)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. Speech and Debate Team Captain - I spent way too many hours preparing and arguing random topics. At one point I was solo coaching my event team (LD) and 8 novices because our debate program director knew nothing about debate and was phoning it in for an extra stipend on his paycheck. 3x state qualifier in multiple events, modest state and national level success. I got a sports letterman jacket for it too.
2. Model UN - I participated on the club team but I wasn't good at it. It was fun though.
3. Tennis - I played on the school freshman team since I had played since I was 5. However, the team head coach at the time basically told me I was blocked from advancing further because of my physical build (not lean enough, too much power), so I quit the school team and just played USTA junior tournaments for the rest of high school.
4. Volunteering - Every week I volunteered at the local library and at a homeless shelter. It was worth it in my opinion if only because it helped shape my worldview which has served me well.
5. UIL Academics - This is a series of academic competitions organized by the Texas state government that any public school can compete in. I was asked to compete in a math competition (Number Sense) and LD debate. I got out of districts once and to regionals for debate but that was it.
6. National Honor Society - I was inducted at the end of Sophomore year and remained in good standing all the way until graduation....when I forgot about the last requirement so I didn't get a special graduation stole.
7. Biotech Lab Intern/HS Research Program - One summer I did guided biotech research as part of a local university program for high schoolers. Another summer I spent a few hours per day growing cell cultures and creating cell culture media for a biotech lab at that same local university.

**Awards/Honors**

1. AP Scholar (distinction)
2. National Merit Commended Scholar
3. I had some kind of small honor from the National Speech and Debate Association
4. Mu Alpha Theta

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Stats Teacher - 10/10, probably my best letter and the person I had the best relationship with. I would not be doing what I do today if not for her.

AP US History Teacher - 9/10, second best letter, I always talked in her class (and would often be the only one), even though sometimes I agitated with contrarian views of history (which got me into arguments with the two people who sat next to me - one of which unironically believed that we should return to the control of the British monarchy, and another who supported neo Nazi thinking....). She appreciated my persistence and determination to push the class beyond.

AP Human Geography/World History teacher - 6/10 - This was probably my weakest letter IMO and it was honestly redundant given my US History teacher's letter.

**Interviews**

Northwestern (interview since abolished) - This was not great because I had no idea what to expect since this was my first interview and online interview resources were way less available back then. I also didn't have anyone in my life or family that had done college interviews before. I talked to the female alum for about 30 minutes, I was nervous AF, and I ran away as quickly as possible.

UT Business Honors (also since abolished) - Awful interview because it happened unscheduled without any warning. I was chilling at home on a couch watching football with my dad when our home phone rang. Turns out the caller was from the Business Honors program and he interviewed me on the spot for admission. Naturally I didn't do the best.

UChicago (also since abolished) - I got used to interviewing by this point and this one felt really casual at a nice coffee shop in town. We had a good conversation, the female alum went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and I felt great about it.

Columbia (also since abolished) - Unremarkable honestly. I have zero memory of what me and the male alum talked about outside of the Wall Street Journal.

UPenn - This one I remember the most because it came up that I was LGBT and so was the male alum (based on his LinkedIn) and it felt validating that an adult accepted who I was (I was still in the closet to friends and family).

**Essays**

Common app + supplements: 8/10. All I remember is that I talked about the big personal interest I had at the time (trash reuse and waste reduction), how I implemented it in my life, and a biotech idea I had for an innovation in composting technology. This was a pain to write because I wasn't confident and got peer feedback that was negative for months. \[And in hindsight this made no sense with what I wanted to study\]

UT: 9/10. It was two long essays. In one I had to talk about the environment I was raised in and how it shaped me as a person (I talked about my religion) and in another I reworked my common app essay about trash to frame it as an interest I had.

UC system: 10/10. I was most proud of these because I could just speak from the heart. It was two long essays. In one I had to talk about the world I came from and how it shaped my dreams/aspirations (again I talked about my religion), and in the other I talked about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience I had (I talked about my experience in speech and debate).

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

I applied only to out of state and dream schools knowing that I had UT Austin automatically clinched as a good option if everything went wrong.

*Acceptances:*

* ***UC Berkeley (graduated 2020)***
* Michigan
* UT Austin (automatic admission, would have been unspecified Business at McCombs)
* UCLA

*Waitlists:*

* NYU (they held me on a waitlist until mid-July --> fun fact, I didn't realize until later that NYU has no statistics department)

*Rejections:*

* UT Austin Business Honors
* UPenn
* UChicago (ED deferred -> rejected)
* Columbia
* Northwestern

**Additional Information:**

Y'all seem to have it rough out there with higher admission standards, higher costs, and a need to overperform in all facets. If I applied today, I feel like I would be in a rough spot and end up at a lesser regarded college. My resume was basically good grades, good test scores and debate.

I would also not have automatic admission at UT Austin to fall back on (since I would miss the top 6% cutoff rule on a rounding error, and next year it's being lowered to top 5%).

I kind of expected these results. The private schools seemed like a parallel inaccessible universe to me, except for UChicago where I thought I had a chance given my interview.

I was legitimately shocked to get into Berkeley, when I opened the email decision letter I screamed my head off for 20 minutes like a mad man. That place made me who I am today and I'm a better person and member of society for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jp703w/a_look_back_a_decade_later_2016_results/,1743541871,,30,4,South Asian,"***UC Berkeley (graduated 2020)***, Michigan, UT Austin (automatic admission, would have been unspecified Business at McCombs), UCLA","NYU (they held me on a waitlist until mid-July --> fun fact, I didn't realize until later that NYU has no statistics department)","UT Austin Business Honors, UPenn, UChicago (ED deferred -> rejected), Columbia, Northwestern, Additional Information:**, Y'all seem to have it rough out there with higher admission standards, higher costs, and a need to overperform in all facets.

**Letters of Recommendation**

LOR's: History teacher - 8-9/10, the teacher that I talked the most to, since he made a great effort to get to know all of his students. He even had conversations with me abt XC and Track, so I think the letter was pretty good. Science teacher - 7/10, pretty good, talked with her a good amount too, so probably good too. Calc teacher - 5-6/10, had him for two years, but I doubt the letter was really good bc he probably would have talked about the rigor of our hs's math department, and less about me, since I didn't really talk to him that much. Only submitted this one to schools that allowed for 3 LORs. XC and Track Coach - 7-8/10, think it was probably pretty good and probably talked about my work ethic and resilience which I think would look great, especially since it is something outside of academics.

**Interviews**

*Rochester* \- 9/10. Felt pretty good, got to talk about a lot of things, not just academically, but my goals in life, about culture on campus, etc. Felt like a casual conversation.

*Grinnell - 8/10.* Technical difficulties, but went along well just like the Rochester interview, just maybe a little less conversational. Learned new information from both interviews and enjoyed both a lot.

**Essays**

* Essays: Probably 8/10. Why major/us essays showed that I did my research on the schools. Why medicine essays were kind of generic, but still very sound in terms of reasoning. My strong points were my Common App Essay and supplementals. Personal statement was about how my dog demonstrated/taught me things, but framed through Carl Roger's client focused approach. Spent a lot of time on refining this one.

**Decisions - All RD unless indicated otherwise**

*Acceptances:*

* University of Pittsburgh (Rolling) + $10k per yr merit + Honors College + got through to the secondary supplemental stage for the GAP BS/MD program, then rejected
* ASU (Rolling) + $13.5k per yr merit + Honors
* UC Merced
* UC Riverside
* University of Rochester + $10k per yr + rejected from REMS bsmd
* Grinnell College + $19k per yr
* Case Western + $28k per yr + rejected from PPSP bsmd
* Carleton College!

*Waitlists:*

* UC Davis (expected to get in especially since Davis is very familiar with our school and knows its strength, especially in the calculus courses)
* UCSD
* UCLA (this one was surprising, was completely expecting a rejection)

*Rejections:*

* UW Madison EA - Deferred ---> Rejected
* UCSB
* UC Irvine
* WashU
* Vanderbilt

**Additional Information:**

Honestly, a crazy application cycle. Was hit with waves of good news and rejections. A lot of places I expected to hear positive news, I didn't, and a lot of places I expected to get flat out rejected from, I ended up getting farther than I thought, waitlisted, or even accepted. My main choices are between Pitt, Case Western, and Carleton, but I am leaning towards Carleton just because I feel it is an excellent fit. I am very grateful for the choices that I have, as I did not expect to be in such a position to deliberate over where to attend.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Duke: was my first interview, nothing exciting, connected well with interviewer and they seemed pretty interested in my stuff

Harvard: I thought it went well, nothing particular to note - was more like a traditional interview with a “checklist” of questions they wanted to ask

Yale: was more like a conversation than an interview and interviewer told me they would put in a strong review  

&#x200B;

**Essays**

Time spent on my supplementals depended, but my main essay was about how I’m not just defined by one thing and all my interests shape who I am

I tried to do everything I could possibly extracurricular wise that was fun to me and didn't make me miserable but don't really know what went wrong and expected better results? I'm open to constructive criticism but know that my EC's were nothing special and despite my test scores and course rigor there is a very large amount of other asian males that do the same in my major if not better.

Princeton - 3/10. The interviewer was not that great at asking questions. He asked about what classes I took and didn't really care about my extracurriculars. When I asked him how Princeton was he said he didn't really like it lmao.

UPenn (non-evaluative) - 10/10. Amazing. We vibed really well.

Georgetown - 6/10. Nothing special

I talked about sewing and how that connected to different facets of my life in my Common App essay. My essays were not very special.

Princeton: In person, went super well 9/10; conversations flowed smooth, but was also under the 30 minute mark. Interviewer was very sweet and social, but we had different majors so there wasn’t much to discuss except for Princeton’s student body/culture. NO NEED TO BE NERVOUS FOR INTERVIEWS, they're just casual conversations. Under 30 minutes.

Barnard: Zoom; probably a 6/10, was part of the CSTEP program. Conversation flowed, asked some questions here and there. Under 30 minutes.

MIT: Zoom; probably a 4/10, my first interview so I was a little nervous! Interviewer was kind of awkward, and I was too! Under the 30 minute mark.

**Essays**

QB: Wrote about healing my relationship with my mother, focusing on themes of combining culture with language/communication 9/10

Common App: Similar to QB, but shortened

Supplements: I think all were pretty good! Mainly did them the day or two before. If I had to choose, Yale’s was my worst. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):** Did QB Match, but did not Match in December! Missed all my EA/ED chances. So all are RDs. I also listed whether I used the CA or QB for each of them, for those who are curious. By the way future Questies, for some schools you can’t change your application from QB to CA, so be careful; and some schools allow you to edit your QB applications, others don't.

*Acceptances:*

* Princeton - QB → Committed, Go Tigers!
* UPenn - QB
* Brown - QB
* USC - CA
* Barnard - CA
* Vassar - QB
* WashU - CA
* Amherst - QB
* Williams - QB
* Bowdoin - QB
* RPI - QB
* SUNY UBuff, SUNY Bing, SUNY Stony Honors - CA

*Waitlists:*

* Duke - QB 
* Cornell - QB = Honestly, I submitted my application super late cause I thought I could use CA, but then Cornell emailed me to redo it on QB 💔
* Northwestern - CA 
* Rice - CA
* Vanderbilt  - QB
* Tufts - CA
* Emory  - QB
* CWRU  - QB

*Rejections:*

* Stanford  - CA
* MIT - QB
* Yale  - QB

**Additional Information:**

For someone with weak ECs (in my opinion, compared to everyone on A2C or chance me, etc.) and started ECs mainly in 11th grade, I did NOT expect to get into any of the Ivies, especially Princeton, or the top LACs. But I guess all of those essays paid off somehow!

TBH, I cried so hard after not getting matched and I hated my QB responses after being rejected from match. But, it all worked out at the end, and that’s all that matters :) 

Let me know if you need any help with QB in September/October, whenever it starts. Make sure to perfect your QB when you submit it in October as that would be the official copy sent to the schools, but you can always email the admissions office / upload updates/changes to your ECs/course load on the portal, which is what I did for a lot of schools.

**CURRENT TOP CHOICE:** ~~UC Berkeley (economics ranked very high) but I also love Rice's community (fell in love with Rice while I wrote my essays). Really hoping a waitlist pulls through though.~~

COMMITTING TO BROWN!!!!

**Additional Notes:**

While I am grateful for the options I have, I honestly came into this cycle expecting more (before I got off the WL for Brown) because of shotgunning to 34 schools and the past admissions trends from my school. However, this process has been EXTREMELY humbling and TRULY helped me understand how merit can ONLY DO SO MUCH in college admissions. Every waitlist and rejection HURT, which made every acceptance feel even more unbelievable. Most of this is just institutional priorities, the environment you grew up in, the year you applied, and how your admissions officer felt that day. College admissions is TRULY RANDOM. This is why it is so important to just live and enjoy your high school life instead of stressing about which college you go to. Luck, happiness, and passion are your best friends, and your future college will recognize that.

FYI, going to an Ivy does NOT make anyone more superior than anyone else. These students are literally normal, but hardworking and passionate, people who got lucky (being kind is apparently optional though...😒). I thought I could become one, but seeing the people from my school and my area who got in made me realize that I still have no fucking clue what colleges want.

But, you can basically get a great future anywhere, whether that be through community college, a top 20, top 50, or top 100 universities. JUST DON'T GIVE UP!!!!!!

**UPDATED Additional Notes**

I am so so grateful to have been taken off the waitlist, and honestly, I’m shaking. However, I still stand by what I said in the additional notes. Admissions are TRULY TRULY random and DOES NOT reflect merit. I readily chose Brown because of its open curriculum and WONDERFUL undergraduate experience, BUT UC Berkeley’s economics is ELITE.

Hope this helped for any future college applicants!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jolz54/mixed_results_of_a_new_england_asian_female_in/,1743477343,1550,,3.99,East Asian,"5. 2x Intl.

1. 1st Place at National JSHS
2. 1st Author Journal Pub in Springer
3. 1st Author Journal Pub in a Q1 Journal
4. Top score in Int Math Modeling Challenge
5. x3 All-State Orchestra Qualifier

**Additional Information:**

I used the full 650-word count to include additional science fair awards, such as Best in Category at the state science fair, as well as patents and participation in conferences like IEEE. I also provided more in-depth descriptions of six different research projects I conducted, and included recognition in music, including a few international awards. My research publications have a citation score of 6. The most compelling project I did involved recording my family's brain waves while they listened to music, and analyzing the data to explore connections to neurological disorders and computational neuroscience. My research mentor highlighted this in his recommendation letter, since it was the project that led to my initial research opportunity. My research was also recognized by a U.S. Congressman. I also won a bunch of math and biology competitions and was recognized by the State Governor for a math comp.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Math teacher - I think it was okay (8/10), but not amazing.

History teacher - Im gonna be honest, I have no idea. I think it was okay but not amazing? (7/10)

Research mentor - Stellar (10/10)

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

UPenn - not evaluative so it doesn't matter but we really connected over dance lol

Duke - AMAZING LIKE GENUINELY THIS WAS THE BEST INTERVIEW I EVER HAD

Yale - It literally went for 2 hours and he even gave me a ride back home while talking about hidden secrets in the AO office which he told me that he wasn't allowed to talk about but told me anyways lmao. Didn't matter though because I got flat out rejected through REA.

Princeton - it was okay, but not amazing. He kept asking me in depth questions and not gonna lie I was kinda blanking.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

My personal statement was okay. I didn't trauma dump or anything, but it was just something that was easy to read and really displayed my personality. I prefer a straightforward, no-BS writing style. I don’t like flowery language and prefer to be concise and to the point.

**Reflection:**

When writing Ivy League essays, don’t fall into the common trap of saying, I want a liberal arts + science education. That’s generic, and admissions officers have seen it a million times. Be specific. I made this mistake myself, and I think that’s why I received so many rejection letters. People always say, *it only takes one*, and I firmly believe that too. But to stand out, your essays must be exceptional and tailored to each school. My recommendation letters weren’t great, and my SAT score was definitely on the lower side compared to most applicants from my school applying to Ivies. Yet, I got into Penn simply because I was highly specific about the opportunities there and connected them to what I was already doing. Also, don’t compare yourself to others. When early action and regular decision results started coming in, I didn’t get into any of my reaches, while a lot of people I knew were sweeping acceptances at top schools. The most important thing is to be happy for them and apply to plenty of safeties to ensure you have solid options. College admissions are unpredictable. I didn’t get into a single T20 school—except for UPenn, which is crazy if you think about it. So, don’t panic if you don’t get into your dream school through early action (for me, that was Yale). As repetitive as this sounds, rejection truly is redirection.

Also, I spent months on my Duke, UChicago, and Yale essays but didn’t get in. Meanwhile, I spent just two days on my UPenn application—and got accepted. This really made me realize that colleges prioritize fit over raw qualifications or stats. While investing time in your essays is important, don’t try to mold yourself into what you think a school wants. Because I spent so little time on UPenn, I ended up portraying myself more genuinely—and they really liked that.

Anyways, UPenn was my 4th choice school, so I'm pretty excited.

**Comments:**

Ngl looking back I kinda wished I applied more reaches, but I am very happy with my decisions. I am still sad about lehigh but it only means better things are coming! I originally applied to most schools for nursing due to the pressure from my parents and I realized I really did not want to do nursing. RIT did not provide nursing major so I applied as a chemE major and lwk I should taker that as a sign as everything happens for a reason. I last minute emailed most AO to change my majors, some I could not like, UT Austin, Smith, and Emory. Right now I am considering between RIT and Tulane for chemical engineering.

**Additional Information:**

I was recruited to play baseball at Caltech - went on official visit and everything and coach told me he gets ""7-8 in/10 every year"" and I ""check all the boxes with admissions"" so I should be good. turns out I got rejected. i heard the admissions committee passed some rule saying that coaches have less say in admissions bc apparently they didn't know before. idk its stupid and that might've killed my chances. rip.

  
i know you don't see much about recruited athletes in this sub, so I figured i'd share my perspectives. my journey was pretty unique if I do say so myself - I was talking to schools like Columbia, Yale, and MIT for a good part of my junior year and had visits and prereads lined up before I played like crap my summer season and most of these schools backed off. If you really want to play your sport in college - DONT GIVE UP! there's always an opportunity somewhere and mine came from caltech. It's sort of a blessing in disguise that I was rejected because I've come to realize that I don't love the sport as much as I thought and taking some time off from ultra competitive baseball might be nice. God's timing is always right - I got into my dream school since I was a kid and can't wait to be on campus next fall!

**Letters of Recommendation**

Introduction To Engineering and Design Teacher: He's a very soulful, philosophical guy. I really connected with him and he regarded me as one of his top students.

AP Language and Composition: He was really great. He and I actually became pretty close friends when I had him as a teacher so hopefully he wrote something good about me.

Counselor: Probably Generic Realistically

**Essays:**

My personal statement addressed my childhood interest in space, the necessity to be curious and constantly ask questions, and how I hope to contribute to further humanity's understanding of the universe. I felt like it was somewhat generic and didn't stand out, especially for my major.

My supplemental essays were kind of hit-or-miss, especially when comparing my EA supplementals to my RD. For a few of them, I talked about how my lack of an individual identity led me to find my own voice through science and space. A couple talked about my heritage and paralleled my family's journey from Asia to America with me going on my own journey to seize every opportunity I could get. Idk I kinda BS'd my way through.

**Interview:**

Princeton: 5/10. It was alright. I wasn't expecting anything from the interview but at least I got a free lunch.

Rejections:

* Princeton (RD)
* Columbia (RD)
* UPenn (RD)

**Comments:**

Yeah, I wasn't expecting to get into any Ivy League. I kind of just applied because why not and I got to fuel my ego my writing about myself even more.

My biggest flaw was not figuring out what I wanted to pursue until mid-junior year and by that time, I didn't have much time to get any engineering/science-related activities under my belt. Another flaw in my application was that I didn't try hard enough in regards to my academics, especially towards my SAT which I felt was the biggest issue with my application as someone trying to major in engineering.

As for where I plan to go, PennState and VTech didn't give me much financial aid so I'm most likely gonna go to my local CC and try to transfer to UMD after a year. I'm not gonna sugarcoat when I say that this hurts like hell. There were genuine times throughout this application cycle when I felt like it was the end of the world and I was a failure. But sometimes life is like that. You get punched, you get back up. You get kicked down, you get back up. No matter what happens, the world is going to keep spinning. So I might as well get off the ground and keep going.

1. *Did comp sci research at NC State through NC School of Science and Math (why did I do comp sci research? I waited too long and then I couldn't be paired with an aerospace OR astronomy project, unfortunately). Not published on a paper but did contribute to the pilot study/some data collection, made my own poster and abstract and presented at the program's symposium*
2. *Science Olympiad since 7th grade. At regionals: school 1st overall every year. Team usually placed top 3. Individually placed 1st-4th in my events (astronomy, dynamic planet, wind power, geologic mapping, etc.). Went to states twice, school placed top 10, individually placed nothing (I am going again this year let's hope I place lmao). Also varsity captain this year.*
3. *Rocketry Club secretary (2y). Participated in American Rocketry Challenge and Techrise (didn't win anything). Got experiment accepted into Cubes in Space (launched a cubesat basically). Led creation of a solar eclipse viewing event (200+ attendees). Also managed other club stuff (files, other event creation).*
4. *Playing piano for almost 14 years. Awardee of my music school's merit scholarship for 9 years. Performing at various recitals (informal and formal) every year. Participant in GMTA (regional), NCMTA (regional/state), and MTNA (state chapter) competitions. Getting the highest regional awards at GMTA/NCMTA, and second highest award at NCMTA states. Nothing at MTNA.*
5. *Playing violin since 6th grade, playing in local regional orchestra group for 5 years. Nothing really leadership here, I was principal violin 2 one year but that was for a middle-level ensemble. Now I'm a first violin in the highest-level ensemble. But we do 4 concerts a year typically. No other competitions w/ violin*
6. *Volunteer @ local science center museum, 86 hours over two summers. Basically supervising kids aged 6-12 in STEM summer camps.*
7. *Volunteer @ local non-profit focused on assisting those in need through food, clothing, and other item donations. Still working there so I'll probably get to 30-35 hours.*
8. *TA/volunteer for my APUSH and AP Lang classes. Also still doing this, so will get 30-35 hours. This is one of my favorite ECs because I just get to help my APUSH teacher lmao*
9. *Tutor through local organization for one summer. Just tutored two kids (4th and 9th) in math, and got 7 hours.*

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. National Merit Finalist
2. AP Scholar w/ Distinction

Two of the awards 3-5 that I put on my CommonApp were specific designations from the ECs I listed above. The other one was ""accepted into Gov. School"" (which my counselor and principal said counted as an honor. Gov School is a summer program but while I got in I didn't attend since I did the research program instead).

**Letters of Recommendation**

**STEM Rec: Comp. Sci/Chemistry Professor**

Took a high level programming class with him in spring 2024, and I was the only junior in that class so I did my best to stand out lmao. Got an A in that class. Now I'm taking chemistry with him. Reasonable relationship with him. Idk how in-depth his rec was though, since he only knew me for a year at most.

(I could've asked my physics teacher for a rec, but I did HORRIBLE in that class).

**Hum Rec: APUSH Teacher**

This would probably be my best rec. I've known him since sophomore year, did great in his class (ignore the 4 on the exam...). I'm super close with him thanks to all my TAing.

**Other Recs:** APES Teacher (supp. rec), Piano Teacher (supp. rec), Research Advisor (research rec)

**Interviews**

Got MIT and Duke interview. MIT interview went okay (1 hour). Talked about traveling and my pet birds a lot. Duke interview was also okay (30 mins). Talked about instrumental ECs and my favorite fields of interest in physics.

**Essays**

I thought my essays for my EA schools were horrible but they still got me accepted so idk. Loved my RD essays but they didn't get me any acceptances--idk. My parents DID pay for one of those professional essay reviewing people—they helped me write my personal statement, Caltech, and UC essays. My personal statement was good (wrote about watching my pet birds) and I guess it offered a unique perspective (more unique than I could've came up with). I think it helped me get accepted but also WL from T20s instead of straight up rejected. (Like, my essays were good enough for them to like me, but I didn't have the ECs or something to make them accept me. Idk.)

**Reflection:**

Honestly, holistically, my results weren't bad at all. However, I'm in a really tough financial situation since my family didn't qualify for aid, but we don't make anywhere close to enough to pay for the schools I got into. I got waitlisted at all of my dream schools that I'd be willing to take loans out to attend (Washu, UNC, Brown, UPenn, Georgetown), but I have to commit to the full-ride scholarship I got for my state school early April, so I don't have time to wait on anything. I'm super sad because I worked hard during high school so I wouldn't have to go to the same university as the mean, lowkey lazy people from my high school, but I'm being forced to because it's too risky to wait on my waitlists when I don't have a backup that makes sense financially.

I know I'll still have great opportunities, and I'm satisfied and proud of what I've accomplished. I'm also insanely grateful for the fact that I'll be getting paid to go to college, but lord, the next 4 years are gonna be tough socially lol

1. NYSSMA mixed choir ensembles- I did ensembles for counties, regionals, and states for multiple years. I practiced extensively for my auditions for these ensembles (usually every day in the months leading up to my audition for states), and preparing for these ensembles often involved frequent rehearsals before and after schools, along with independent practice. My audition is how I was selected for all eastern. This time also let me develop my abilities as a solo classical singer.
2. Mock Trial (2 years)- Met 3-4 times a week afterschool (around 12 hours a week)- we were an underdog team, and even though I served as a witness, we all put in a ton of work.
3. Musicals- Part of HS productions every year and did a few productions of out of school where I had lead/supporting roles. Often was about an 6-hour commitment a week, with more during tech weeks.
4. Participated as a member of my local math league, NYSML, and ARML math league competitions (state and national team competitions). I was usually pretty bad at these because I never practiced, but the colleges thankfully never knew that. Pretty low time commitment but did it for all of high school.
5. I had a paid internship at a small local personal injury law office where I shadowed lawyers, did paralegal work, researched, and watched depositions. Was roughly 30 hours a week for a month or two in the summer.
6. Was part of my school's full and select acapella club, which met every week for all of my years of high school. I learned to sing contemporary music and served as the club's treasurer(and the choir treasurer).
7. I also served as a part-time produce worker at a local farm stand, where I stocked produce and checked its quality. About 10 hours a week for a few months.
8. President of NHS- organized events, and that's pretty much it beyond the typical volunteering stuff
9. While I was doing that organic chemistry class, I was also participating in Harvard's summer and chamber choir, and we performed a variety of pieces, including a Bach cantata. We met twice a week, which was a lot considering the courseload of the other stuff I was doing.
10. I was part of the A team of my science Olympiad team for 4 years. We only ever reached regionals, but I regularly medaled in various events.

**Awards/Honors**

1. Selected for NAFME All-Eastern Choir (there is no longer nationals to qualify for)
2. Top 3 in mock trial states
3. regional medalist in Scioly
4. AP Scholar with Distinction
5. Seal of Civic Readiness

**Letters of Recommendation**

My APUSH teacher- 8/10. I took APUSH, black history, and he ran the mock trial team. He had a very positive opinion of me, and I was a very active participant in all of those things. I did very well in all of his classes. He is also known as a compelling and thoughtful writer.

My calculus teacher- 9/10. I took precalculus, Calc AB, and did all of the math competition stuff with her. I did very well in her class, and spent most of my time doing extra challenge problems that I thought were fun and making my own. I also self-studied the BC content, which she was impressed by. We have a strong relationship, and she also has an English degree, so she is a strong writer.

**Interviews**

Princeton Interview- (6/10) I think I gave good responses to most of my questions and showed my passion for Princeton, however I didn't connect that strongly with the interviewer, and he was really busy, so our interview was rather short.

Harvard Interview (7/10)- Interviewer seemed to like me, and I thought I gave some solid responses. We talked for about an hour.

**Essays**

I've been told that all of my essays were high quality. All of my essays went through thorough revisions. I don't really have a tragic story or some incredible achievement, so my essays were primarily about just showing my personality and passions. My personal statement was about my love of stories and books, and how Magic: The gathering, chemistry, and music, were stories themselves, and inspired me to bring those stories to others It had a funny hook and a circular narrative. It was a montage essay with a strong underlying thread. I spent probably 35 or so hours drafting and editing it.

1jobocu,International got steamrolled by all t20's and ivies - Need Help deciding next steps,"As the title says, i applied as an international for fall'25 and got rejected from every single one of my regular decision schools totalling a massive 15 rejections in a row. I was asking for aid (almost a full ride) and i am fully aware of how much of a absurd gamble it is for my demographic but not being able to manage a singular waitlist/acceptance has crushed ever last drop of hope i had in me. i was ready to put it to bed but hearing my friends (similar demographics needing aid) getting at least a few waitlists/acceptances from decent reaches with lower stats than me makes me wonder if something went horribly wrong with my app.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lang Teacher (6/10) - She knew me decently well but I didn't have a crazy close relationship with her. She also writes 60 LOR each year so I don't think mine was that great. 

AP Calc AB (8/10) - She wrote me 2 different LORs, knew a lot about me, and I am close to her. She wrote extensively about me finding my passion for math/engineering. 

Counselor (6/10) - Switched counselors midway through high school, didn't know her that well. 

**Essays**

Personal Statement (5/10) - I wrote the entire thing the day ED1 was due; it was pretty bad and super generic.

Supplementals (7.5/10) - I thought these were pretty creative but I also did all of them day before or day of so they could have been more polished. 

PIQs (8/10) - I started writing these day before the app was due, finished 3 hours before the deadline. I thought they demonstrated my interests and who I was pretty well; everyone who read these thought they were great.

I had family circumstances that affected my academics in my Sophomore year responsible for my 2 B's and 3 in Euro, explained them in my UC app. 

Overall, I am so happy that I bagged Cal, it's been my dream school since Freshman year. I'm being deadass, I write better when I'm under pressure, hence the insane procrastination on my PIQs, which I finished the day the app was due. It really only takes one.

**Letters of Recommendation**

I didn't read any of them, but had good relations with all my recommenders.

**Interviews**

I had three for the USNA, one from my Blue and Gold Officer and two from committees for Senator nominations.

\- BGO: Nerves were high at first, but it went well. I was told it was mainly to prepare me for the nomination interviews though

\- Senator 1: One of the interviewers was an instructor at another NJROTC unit and recognized me and did most of the questioning. Another interviewer also said that my academics were amazing, so I think it went really well.

\- Senator 2: The interviewers were both older veterans, so there was definitely a disconnect on some level. It was never awkward per say, but it was unlike the other two. Was pretty meh.

**Essays**

Aside from supplemental essays, there's my USNA essay and my CommonApp essay. For the former, I spent a lot of time on it when the school year started. One of my friends, who also applied there, said that it made them want to unsubmit and rewrite theirs, so I think I cooked. After I submitted my Academy application, I focused on my CommonApp essay. I talked about my motivation for joining the military, a decision that always seemed to shock my peers. I got a handwritten note from my RPI admissions officer about it because they had also visited Ground Zero in NY.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Computer science teacher. I've known her since middle school so I think she had a lot of good things to say about me though. I think she rushed the letter though so I'll say 7 or 8/10.

Precal teacher. I had him in junior year and he was a very chill teacher who liked me. I always did well in his class but didn't know him too well. 6 or 7/10.

English teacher. Had her in sophomore and junior year. She was a strict teacher, but I think she has good things to say about her students. She didn't even ask me for a resume so everything she wrote had to come from what she thought of me which was probably good things. I didn't know her too much though but this letter was likely the more unique out of the three. 7 or 8/10.

Counselor. She submitted a counselor recommendation in the common app but didn't ask for information about me. I had only spoken to her a few times. I have no clue what she included in there. ?/10.

**Interviews**

None

**Essays**

My common app essay was about making an aquascape. The message of it was about how striving for perfection ultimately led me to burning out and how perfection is not needed to create something that works amazingly. I don't think I'm explaining it well here, but everyone who read it thought it was unique and liked it a lot. 8/10.

I rushed my supplemental essays a bit. I think I could've definitely put more work into them. 6 or 7/10.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Primary English and social science teacher for my HS honors literature and social science courses: 9/10, we had a great relationship and she offered to write it.

Genetics Professor: 6-7/10, I’m sure the rec was fine but I asked for it on short notice so I’m not sure.

iGEM mentor who also connected me with Hopkins researcher who I was sorta talking to about EC 7 and medical entomology field: 10/10 she had me review it herself

Executive Director of organization responsible for ECs 5 and 9 and ‘award’ 4: 5/10 it wasn’t bad but it wasn’t good either. She procrastinated on it till the last minute.

**Interviews**

Interviews when I got them always went exceptionally well. Interviews are probably the strongest part of my appp after ECs.


**Essays**

My CAPS was about how I became interested in my intended career path, and reflecting how my upbringing, experience with getting hay mites, antkeeping, and a bunch of other stuff influenced how I got to it. I think it’s a really strong foundation, some grammar errors though.

I reused 2 main essays.

One about the journey from seeing the issue my business solves, working on it at iGEM, and then the process and results I’ve achieved through my biz

The second was about the Youth research and how my interactions with the company as a whole led to me becoming a global citizen.

**Essays:**

I liked most of my essays especially my UCs and common app essay. My personal essay was about a unique ritual regarding fish, and how I learned that both small and big issues mattered. My UC PIQs were all centered around helping my community while pursuing my different passions.  But my other supplementals were a bit suspicious, as I rushed most of them and was lost by the prompts. That is also probably why I didn't get into any school out of the UC system.

My essays were proofread by like 5+ essay readers/ tutors so I know they weren't ""bad"", since the company my parent works for offered these free services.

1jneyci,new-to-admissions rural kid absolutely demolishes T20 admissions,"My college admissions journey has been an unusual one. While many start with dream schools in their preteens and early teen years, I didn’t give college a glancing thought until about April of my junior year. Even then, I doubted I could go to a top 20 school; my plan until August of last fall was to go to Idaho State University as a physics major and see what happened from there. But, by chance, I stumbled across the ApplyingToCollege Discord server, which saw my profile as one worthy of top schools and encouraged me to apply. I bit the bullet and chose an REA and a handful of RD schools, ending up adding more and more as I went. The process was extremely difficult for me, having very little support from my school, so a lot of my misconceptions about college admissions were only caught by the kind people of A2C.

* Senior Year Course load: Dual Enroll Calc (Approximately equivalent to BC Calc), normal Physics, Dual Enroll Writing and Rhetoric, Dual Enroll Government, Jazz Band, Robotics, Middle School Teaching Hour, Personal Finance
* A few comments on course availability: Physics and Calc are also not available at my high school, and there is a near zero amount of serious rigor available too. I went above and beyond by being the first senior to take physics and calculus since they were dropped from our school five years ago. 
* Additionally, I forgoed foreign lang due to scheduling conflicts, so I only had one FL class under my belt when app season rolled around.

Worst awards section of all time \^

**Essays:**

If you ask me, most of them were pretty good. I rushed through a few schools and tended to recycle a lot, with heavy editing to tailor it to the prompt. My personal essay was about learning to trust myself with important responsibilities in FRC when I couldn’t be in the shop as often due to music and my job. My other essays were heavily focused around the impact I have had on my community and how my activities and accomplishments have made my town a better place to live, as well as made my life better.

If you ask my teachers who proofed them, they were earth-shatteringly phenomenal. Apparently the AOs agreed, so 10/10 I guess.

senior year: ap csp, ap lit, ap gov/econ, ap calc bc, ap chem, de astronomy (1st sem), de stats (1st sem), de physical science (1st sem), de lang comp (2nd sem), de spanish 4 (2nd sem)

testing: 1450 SAT, mix of 4s and 3s on AP tests (barely got distinction lol)

ec’s/awards (keeping these brief):
- astronomy club co-founder/president: biweekly meetings with 40+ students and school-wide guest speaker events
- club soccer: team captain, regional level, “vip games” against adults w/ special needs a few times per year, reached highest bracket before team disbanded :(
- varsity track: league champs in 4x100, assistant coach, multiple running events, etc
- family responsibilities: brother w/ severe special needs, assisted in tons of daily tasks, became certified respite care provider 

these were my main activities, but i was also on the board of a few clubs that were heavily involved within the school/community (raised ~$800), and i did volunteering at a nonprofit for children w/ down syndrome. i also got to teach a ton of kids at my elementary school about astronomy and rocketry which was sick :) my awards were pretty basic (math/national honor society, ap scholar, biliteracy seal) but i did win two statewide awards for community service and impact

essays/lor’s: no comment on my essays. they were all started and completed the day they were due with very few edits besides my PIQs which i gave myself two extra days to get done 🤪 i think im a better writer under pressure so that + tons of luck led to my results!

my lor’s were definitely decent. i chose two teachers that i know are fantastic at writing and who saw my drastic improvements over the course of the two years i had them (ap lang and ap calc ab, both soph/junior year). they have some insight on my personal life/home situation and i specifically asked them to shed light on that because i knew my grades were not up to par with other applicants at these top schools

atp i was so happy with slo and planning on committing. but then i was accepted to:

- uc berkeley!!
- UCLA!! (dream school since forever)
- and cornell?!? i’m still shocked 😭

additional info: i acknowledged that my grades were def the major downfall in my application. my freshman gpa was literally <3.0 unweighted. however, i did have substantial improvement. my C’s were my first three semesters of high school, my junior year was a 4.6, and my first semester senior year was a 4.0/5.0 across 8 classes (11 if you include my summer courses). i dealt with really terrible SA at my middle school, so i spent my freshman year at a new school where i didn’t know anybody. i was terrified of what happened in middle school and therefore struggled a ton. first semester of sophomore year my house flooded and we were forced to move on very little notice. my brother also has severe autism and most of junior year i was his main caretaker because my parents became super busy with my grandparents. i explained all of this in my additional info and my personal statement was about my experience with SA and how it shaped me and my growth, which i think helped. it was kind of a cliche topic but it worked out in the end!

tldr: silly high school upbringing + crazy improvement = good results! 

again, i’m so grateful for the opportunity to choose between such amazing schools. i genuinely thought id be going straight to my local cc, especially after countless hours scrolling through this subreddit and a2c. 

for my juniors, don’t let others tell you how you’re going to end up. my own college counselor told me i’d get rejected from all of my targets/reaches. it’s never over!!

**Letters of Recommendation**

* Math Teacher 8.5/10
   * Had him for both sophomore and junior years, he offered to write it for me before I asked. Saw me go from Cs to As in both classes, and knows that math is not even CLOSE to my best subject, or even a good one. Very big on the perseverance angle, and he also went to both Harvard AND Stanford? Yet volunteered to write for me? Didn't read it, but still fairly happy bc I know he really enjoyed me as a student due to me being one of the few who actually asked questions, + had to pop in and out of his class a lot BC of my EC's/school support, and he saw a lot of my ECs.
* AP Lang Teacher 9/10
   * Writes limited letters, and is known for writing INSANELY good ones. I also TA for her AP Lang class this year -> she's seen me help a lot of people and I hang out in her classroom before/after school a lot as well, we have a very close relationship and I trust her a lot to write well about me. I appreciate her work a lot, and I know she does the same to mine. She once wrote me 4 handwritten pages of feedback for an essay I got 90% on just because she believed in my improvement/me, so I have high hopes for this one!
* APUSH Teacher 8/10
   * Like the others, I haven't seen this, but he says he doesn't write as well as English Teacher, but I think he probably wrote very well. I did VERY well in his class, + stayed in his classroom after school a lot, and popped into his homeroom a lot. Enjoyed history, talked about it a lot, and generally very happy with the subject. I only submitted this to a few schools that required history (GTown and a couple LACs), but I overall think he had a lot of good things to say.
* Counselor 9/10
   * She LOVES me, I always make a point to talk to her and say hi. She let me take a senior class as a sophomore and I talk to her a lot about my classes and extracurriculars. I'm also our schools Lead Ambassador, so I work directly with her and the counseling office, so she's seen my ECs in action a lot. Oh, I also wrote an email to the school board to help save her job and the counseling department during budget cuts. She's seen a lot of my achievements and a lot of my community work, so I have pretty high hopes!
* Nonprofit Manager - 10/10
   * Watched me grow in workshops in the nonprofit to leading them. Great examples of my community work + personality, lots of achievements. Was able to talk about awards, UN work, grantwriting/organization in the nonprofit, museum work, etc, and vouched for my writing. Reading this nearly made me cry :)
* Peer Rec - 8/10
   * For Dartmouth. This one was really sweet and also nearly made me cry, but it's also a peer rec, and couldn't speak to much outside personality and in-school EC's, but I think was really good overall. I showed it to my father and he thought it was AI (it was not), but talked a lot about my achievements in-school ECs.

**Interviews**

* Georgetown
   * Everyone gets a Georgetown int., but this went really well- she went to the school in GTown that I was interested in, and works in nonprofits, which was my future goal. She works in blood services, diabetes, etc, and I was able to talk about running blood drives. Great connection to start with and asked questions really clearly and made the environment stress-free.
* Harvard
   * Went really well. My interviewer took like four pages of notes, and started writing anytime I mentioned an achievement- if that's what they're looking for, keep that in mind for prep! He was interested in answering my questions, and we had a pretty formal, but interview that went amazing nonetheless.
* Princeton
   * Phone interview. Went alright. Not bad, not amazing. Interviewer felt more interested in asking me to ask him questions than listening to me.
* Stanford
   * AMAZINGLY well. Guy literally bought me a coffee- but we were able to talk about journalism, and he was genuinely interested in what I had to say. Stanford ints are supposed to be 40 minutes and mine lasted 80, so I think that's a good sign. Very interested in my ECs + future plans and appreciated questions I asked him.
* Columbia
   * Didn't go great- the two interviewers clearly weren't on the same wavelength, one was far more formal than the other, and the questions went all over the place rather than a natural progression or pattern. However, the questions were VERY specific to their program, and I didn't research much beforehand.

**Essay**

* Main Essay (8/10) - I think it was a really good essay, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest thing ever. Wrote about having a speech impediment as a child -> getting over it and using my voice for importance. Teachers/counselors + adults I showed it to liked it a lot!
* Supplementals: I actually worked pretty hard on supplementals, and ended up with bases to re-use. My NYU supplementals were pretty short, only 250 words, but I made a big point of NYU + my future goals.

**Additional Information:**

I was up against the international pool, despite going to a U.S. high school. I'm happy with my acceptances, but the full smack from the Ivy League hurt a lil. Let me know if you have any questions! I've also enrolled in NYU for the fall, and I am VERY happy as it was my first choice. I also primarily applied to specific programs at schools rather than just the school (such as Columbia, where I applied to a Dual BA program & NYU). Let me know if I can help or if there's anything interesting! I withdrew a lot of targets (I had a LOT of targets due to paranoia) after I got into USC EA, which was one of my top choices. I also had NO business EC's, so I'm just grateful for the business programs I got into.

2. Chemistry teacher (7/10): They've known me for four years and they're the advisor for two of my clubs. I'm just not sure how much they know about me though.

Essays: (8/10) I'm decently good at writing, but I'm not as good when it comes to reflecting on my own experiences. My personal essay was about how as a leader, I serve as the ""fertilizer"" that nurtures others. Some other topics that I wrote about is how supportive communities help people reach their full potential, using Butoh as a way to confront myself, and how sharing food/culture creates deeper connections. My essays were checked by my dad.

Interviews: (8.5/10) All of them went pretty well. The people that I interviewed with were very friendly. I did the interview for F&M, Swarthmore, Georgetown, Dickinson, Haverford, and W&L.

**Additional Information:** I'm still waiting on Duke, but I'm expecting a rejection! Overall, I'm pretty happy with my results. As you can see, my ECs were all over the place, but somehow, I was able to make it work. My advice is that you shouldn't stop yourself from pursuing your interests just because of college applications! It's fine if you only want to focus on one thing, but if you want to do a lot of different things, go for it! Try your best to see how they mesh together and focus on the intersections. A lot of schools like it when you explore interdisciplinary subjects (especially LACs), so don't limit yourself! Also, bonus points if you focus on something that is super niche.

Another piece of advice is to focus on is figuring out how you're going to sell yourself. What makes you different from all the other applicants? What something that only you can bring to the table? Why does the college need *you*? Honestly, I struggled a lot with this part since I don't know myself well enough and I can't objectively evaluate myself. For that part, you might want to get some help from people who know you very well. The ""Why this college?"" question was also something that was really hard for me to answer. I mean, if you think about it, most colleges offer practically the same things. Even if something is unique to some colleges, it's usually not unique to a single college.

For interviews, I recommend checking out the questions from UPENN. I did that for most of my interviews and it definitely helped with making sure that I wouldn't have to come up with things on the spot. I'm not that good when it comes to speaking and sharing my thoughts on the spot, so I found it very helpful. I regret not doing this for Haverford, especially since it's my top school. I'm very glad that I was accepted despite my lack of preparation.

I hope you found some of this to be helpful! Good luck to everyone who will be applying to colleges in the future!",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jn5hmf/asian_with_mixed_ecs_gets_into_dream_school/,1743311854,1540,,3.93,East Asian,"Lycoming College (Direct Admit), Arcadia University (Direct Admit), Robert Morris University (Direct Admit), Wingate (Direct Admit), Duke Kunshan (RD; Did not request for financial aid, but received merit that gave 40% off of tuition), Drexel University (EA), University of Richmond (EA), UMD College Park (EA), University of Pittsburgh (Rolling), Dickinson College (RD), University of Virginia (RD), Haverford College (RD; TOP CHOICE!!!), Washington and Lee University (RD; Johnson Scholarship Finalist - I didn't get the full ride, but I got close to a full ride), Wesleyan University (RD), Vassar College (RD), Community College (Direct Admit, full tuition)","Franklin & Marshall College, Lafayette College, Johns Hopkins University, Wake Forest, Swarthmore College, Georgetown University","Northwestern, The Juilliard School, Northeastern, Williams College, UNC Chapel Hill, Amherst College, UPENN, Harvard University, Brown University, Yale University",Male

Third was my counselor. She likes me and i think she wrote a great rec for me

Nothing too crazy, my common app was about my self confidence issues as an engineer. I can’t really grade my own essays without being bias, but for some schools i talked about their mottos which i think was a good move 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

I was deferred SCEA from Princeton then rejected from Harvey Mudd, MIT, and JHU and waitlisted from CMU and Northeastern and accepted to my in state school’s honors college. I was pretty disappointed and expected nothing out of Ivy day.

Ivy day:
Harvard: Denied
Yale: Denied
Dartmouth: Waitlisted
Cornell: ACCEPTED
Brown: ACCEPTED
Princeton: ACCEPTED!
Ivy day was such a relief, i was so disappointed during the week before. I’m glad i didn’t fully lose hope though and in the end some decisions came back as accepted. Still can’t believe it

* Gender: male
* Race/Ethnicity: Vietnamese
* Residence: San Bernardino County (shocking, I know. A SoCal Viet not from OC or LA??)
* Income Bracket: low income
* Type of School: decently competitive public high school
* Hooks: First Gen 

**Intended Major(s)**: Microbiology (intended pre-med route)

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 4.0 UW/4.682 W (including PE 2 years)
* Rank (or percentile): 26/771
* \# of Honors/AP/Dual Enrollment.: Honors: 6 (2 freshman year, 3 sophomore year, 1 junior year), AP: 12 (1 freshman year, 1 sophomore year, 5 junior year, 5 senior year), Dual Enrollment at my local community college: 10 (1 sophomore summer, 3 junior summer, 3 senior fall, 3 senior spring)
* Senior Year Course Load: Academic Decathlon, AP Art History, AP Calc BC, APES, Ap Gov(fall)/AP Econ(spring), AP Lit

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT: 1460 (710 RW, 750 M) (most of the schools I applied to didn't require this, so I did this for fun because I'm a lunatic and my counselor was like ""it's free."" I love free...)
* AP: APCSP (3, we don't talk about this. I genuinely hard cope and think I scored a 0 on the project and 100% on the theory portion), AP World (4), APUSH (4), AP Psych (5), AP Lang (4), AP Physics 1 (4), AP Biology (4), recorded doing AP Art History, AP Calc BC, APES, AP Econ, and AP US Gov exams this spring.
* CAASP (only mattered for slo and sdsu): Above Average (or something along those lines. Also, I think I almost max scored math or something?)

**Extracurriculars/Activities (I'm cooked chat (What's a four year commitment?))**

1.  Volunteer peer tutoring for the school (\~3 hours per week; 10th and 11th grade)
2.  Clinical Shadowing (20 hours per week, 4 week program over junior summer) (fun fact, this is also where I was like ""microbiology is cool."" Also, I lucked out so hard on this. This was the closest hospital to me AND the program itself was free, minus the uniform) 
3.  Speech and Debate Treasurer (11th grade member, 12th grade officer position, no competitions)
4.  Hospital Volunteer (3 hours per week; 12th grade school year) (same hospital as the shadowing program actually)
5. More volunteer peer tutoring (but this time for a different program) (2.1 hours per week, each 'bootcamp' was 4 weeks)
6. Academic Decathlon (only 12th grade. I actually won stuff at regionals on the B team too, but guess what... it was too late for college apps)
7. California Scholarship Foundation Member (9th, 10th, 12th; they didn't have CSF for 11th graders because they couldn't find an advisor)
8. STEM Club Member (9th grade only, you know I'm cooked when I'm padding with stuff FROM 9TH GRADE LMAOOO)

If it wasn't obvious, I didn't lock in on my ecs until late 11th grade. Also, I was on a mega budget here with the most expensive thing here being the uniform for the Clinical Shadowing program (I think it was $20 or $40, I have shoddy memory). Definitely regret not doing/having more here, especially since I love competing, but it is what it is.

**Awards/Honors** (note: I trolled kinda hard and forgot about being commended for the PSAT :P)

1. AP Scholar
2. National First gen thing from CollegeBoard
3. Superintendent's Honor Roll

**Letters of Recommendation (for berk and brown)**

AP Lang/Soph. English teacher: Probably like a 7/10? I had him for two years straight, and I did well in his class. 

AP Physics teacher: probably like a 6/10? I don't think I was standout compared to my peers, but I do have a good relationship with her.

**Essays**

UC PIQS:

* What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?
   * Talked about competitive singles Pokémon and how that translates to risk management. Like an 8.5/10.
* Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.
   * Talked about motivation drop in eighth grade year (I wonder why that could've been...). Like a 7/10. Good but somewhat generic.
* Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement? 
   * Deeply personal so I won't go into too much depth but just know that I got my extremely stoic English teacher to tear up. 10/10
* Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom**.**
   * Opened up the essay with how my cousin made me a history buff initially and then I fell down the rabbit hole of studying diseases after learning about the Black Plague. 8/10

Every other essay for the other schools (meaning Brown) is a derivative of these, so just imagine these but like minus 4 points.

**Letters of Recommendation**

spanish teacher 9/10: bcs i applied as a linguistics major it was important that a foreign language teacher write at least one of my LORs, she taught me for two years and i seemed to have left a lasting impression on her. in her own words, i'm ""one of few people who make learning a language look easy"". 

english/history teacher 6/10: had him in a socratic seminar style class where i basically led seminar every morning. he only taught me for one year-which was also his first year teaching so unsure as to how well he really knew me as a student. 

**Interviews** 

harvard 6/10: the only interview i got, interviewer was 30 mins late but the conversation felt as natural as it could be, i did a lot of bg research on him so it was easy to ask questions abt him rather than answer questions of my own. might have asked a few obvious questions and come off as immature but oh well. 

**Essays**

common app essay: about my part time job at kumon helping a student with special needs become a more fluent reader and what that taught me about empathy as an educator and linguistics, and how it shaped my own journey with language acquisition. 

supplementals: ranged from other experiences tutoring to studying abroad in korea for a summer, cooking + cleaning for my grandmother, exploring my identity as a queer woman of color, and babblings about linguistics (sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, linguistic elitism)

**Additional Information:**

...for context i speak five languages (one of these self-taught), so instead of focusing on what i had already accomplished, i tried to frame my application around my raw talent and potential as a prospective student. 

the opportunities at my high school are rather limited in terms of student leadership, which shows pretty obviously in my lack of extracurriculars. so knowing this, i worked really hard editing my common app and supplemental essays to make up for it. if i were to do this all over again, i probably wouldn't apply to the schools that didn't have my major and forego applying to the uc's completely (i think them being test-blind worked against my favor). but in all, i would say this was a very successful cycle for me and i'm very satisfied with the results. best of luck to anyone seeing this!

math teacher - strict teacher but was very kind. Not a lot of people talked to him because there was a lot of stigma with how rude he was, but I talked a lot with him and found him really chill. He's kind of like a drill sergeant. 

econ teacher - nice person, talked a lot. Did well in his class and showed up for some events he hosted outside of school. Awesome guy.

# COMMITTED: EMORY

  
Kind of planned to ED to Emory but then I had some NYU Stern phase that didn't exactly work out. Thought I'd be screwed RD but I guess Emory held out a hand for me. Honestly looking back at the apps process, I'd say to just apply to the schools that you're genuinely interested in. Also, just be genuine in your commonapp. I tried to tailor my supplements towards certain schools and I don't think that played in my favor. The one supplement I didn't nitpick to death was Emory for some reason, and looking back I thought it was a lot better than the rest.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Ratings are my guesses, prolly not accurate

CS Teacher (7/10): Did a really good capstone project (which is basically all that is there to highlight)

English Teacher (8/10): Was in his class in junior year. He liked that I participated and was willing to engage with his literary analysis .

Research Mentor (8/10): My work was summer after 11th grade. He said that he wrote ""I have the DNA to become one of the top students at any university"" in his rec. I was the only high schooler in the group.  

Math Circle Teacher (7/10): I did a lot of courses with him for all my four years in school. I think it should have been average. 

**Interviews**

MIT: One of the best interviews. The guy was interesting and we talked around 1hr 30 mins. 9-10/10

Princeton: Completely bombed it. Not much more to say. 1/10

Yale: Lasted 1 hr long. Think I showed a good mix of STEM and humanities and my interviewer was p. nice. Honestly tho its average. 7/10

Stanford: It was average. Only lasted 45 minutes. We just went on what my ideas for my future jobs are and why.  6/10.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: About my family and how I value it 8-9/10

UC PIQs: I felt good about all my piqs. 7/10

Supplementals: I think it was good. Spent a lot (i mean a LOT) of time on ivies and Stanford apps. Took very creative and thoughtful approaches. Maybe around a 8-9/10.

**Final Thoughts:**

Would have been really nice if I got a big 4 CS (MIT, Stanford, UCB, CMU) or some ivies but I don’t think I have too bad options. Honestly I’m very grateful that I have the acceptance and schools I have but I was a bit bummed the last few days because it was rejection after rejection. 

The biggest thing I drew from the process is just how random it is. Really for other who are lurking around please don’t hope that you get in to schools because when I did that and got rejected it hurt double. 

I’m not sure where I’ll commit.

math team advisor - when i moved here at my new school i started the team like on my first day during orientation which kind of had aura ig. it became pretty successful at my school and she wrote a fire rec letter. good relationship as well.

econ teacher - he's my goat. he did some analogy of me being a ""navigator"" and his rec letters got my friend into harvard asw.

number theory prof - my goat too. good relationship. genuinely my goat bro.

math program prof - probably rlly generic but just needed this to make my program more authentic

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

pton interview - went to my hs and we had a good convo for about an hour. talked about law, engineering, my goals and typical stuff. notable aura moment is me showing him that 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1 through the proof so i could explain to him why pure math is cool 💀

For RD, I started supps probably during christmas. I had brown and pton supps ready but my CAPS wasn't ready yet. CAPS is rlly hard because there's nothing to guide you tbh. you just got to thug it out. i'll add more about essays in the bottom.

caps - talked about moving and how i look for growth everywhere

pton supp #1 - my favorite essay talking about how my immigration status has inspired me to put humanity first

why major - the structure is: glaze pure math -> then talk about how i also love applied math through neuroscience and physics

**Additional Information:**

ecs and awards are really weak but they are good relative to my region. state helped a decent bit. LORs got me in. math spike also helped me get in.

  
**Reflection:**

**to other h4 dependents:** princeton is the only school that considers us domestic applicants. consider applying! all the other t20s i applied to had the same application quality as Princeton's, but the only difference is that the other t20s consider me international (either need-blind or quota). 

**to procrastinators:** although procrastinating helps you think faster and really lock in with the adrenaline flowing, i'd like to note that the background supp I wrote (the one about my immigration status) was probably 7/10 for princeton, but five days later after adjusting it to other schools, when I submitted my yale application late I had the best version of the essay. like genuinely my yale essays were fire but my ecs are weak for the international pool. so in order to get the adrenaline still working for y'all, maybe do all 14 applications during thanksgiving break (act like it's due asap). this will force u to think fast while getting better at writing. i got a lot of help from asking people on the a2c discord to review my essays and read through this guys blogs to help me understand how to approach writing: [https://essaymechanic.com/](https://essaymechanic.com/)

**essay:** the personal statement is your story, so take the ""avoid X topic"" with a grain of salt. common wisdom suggests that writing about moving is over done, and this really fucked with me. i spent atleast 3 hrs a week from september trying to figure out how i was gonna write this and for EA i wrote a bad essay about how the gym taught me to perservere through hurdles. 

the personal statement that i wrote for rd was when i was like screw it and wrote about moving. although it was significantly better than my old essay, it was probably still just 6/10 at best. i didn't have enough depth to kind of show who i really was. but again as a note to procrastinators, i couldn't have made it my best 10/10 because time was approaching. 

**math spike:** for younger freshman and stuff out there if you've figured out what you like just go lock in on that. i did this and took classes in linear algebra, group theory, real analysis, topology, measure theory, recursive functions, number theory, field theory. furthermore, if i locked in sophomore year for comp math i could've made AIME twice for sure but i got lazy with competitive math. but you don't need a spike for sure ik people who got in without one.

I could have worked on improving my ACT score and tried to raise my GPA earlier on. Maybe I should have explained my story and activities in a clearer way.

**letters of recommendation**

geometry teacher: ♾️/10, best and nicest person i could ask. my teacher saw me grow through all four years of HS and i have a very special relationship with the subject he taught. he became a monk a few years ago now and i visit ever-so-often, and he's been a huge guiding figure and inspiration to me :)

english teacher: 100/10, he's now an assistant principal (and runs the student council) at my school and also saw me grow through HS. he watched me obsess over my favorite books and helped me re-evaluate how i approach a lot of challenges in leadership (and literature too lol)

supplementary rec: 100/10 from my religious teacher who casually moonlights as a government official and a prof at georgetown, she's the coolest person i've met and wrote a glowing rec, especially because she's seen me grow in my religious identity

**interviews**

* mit: 4/10, my interviewer didn't ask me any questions and frequently commented that we had nothing in common to talk about during our interview. it did run about 1.5hrs, but i was in agony the entire time. also, they made some very interesting comments throughout the entire time that made me uncomfortable, and i basically just retold all of my essays bc the entire thing gave me whiplash
* duke: 10/10, i loved my duke interviewer. he was incredibly nice and we went overtime discussing his favorite moments on campus.
* yale: 100/10, amazing interview. i had a mid-march senior interview and it was supposed to only be 30mins. (went to 42 anyways), and we spoke about my experiences and the thesis I'm currently working on.

**essays**

* common app personal statement: 8/10, didn't work on it after october-ish. wrote about geometry, religion, and discovering my love for solving math proofs with my friends (and the ""secret society"" we made) and my appreciation for islamic/persian culture after finding beauty in geometry
* supplemental: 8.5/10, i recycled them pretty well but also tailored them to the schools i applied to. yale, columbia, and stanford were definitely the most fun — the 50 word responses were really difficult but also a fun challenge.
* i had a lot of current HS seniors read over my essays, but i do wish i consulted my teachers and mentors more in the process — looking back, i see a lot of ways i could've showed more intellectual vitality and my own personality if i had the perspective of someone who's worked with a lot of students to guide my process. still satisfied with how everything turned out!

**Letters of Recommendation**

* Math teacher; did not read but like this seemed to work out
* Counselor (8/10)
* Debate coach (10/10; so kind and so sweet)
   * Dartmouth peer rec was same
* English teacher (8/10; def good although it was like the same exact some thing)

**Interviews**

I got interviews at all of the ivies I applied to that offered them as well as Georgetown and Middlebury/Bowdoin. 

* **Bowdoin** (10/10)  we talked for 90 minutes and she eventually just started telling me what to do there…sweetest person ever i truly loved her) 
* **Georgetown** (0/10) this was my first interview and also my worst)
* **Middlebury** (8/10 again SO kind and SO lovely she was very sweet hehe) 
* **Dartmouth** (6/10 I got this request sorta late so i was checked out of “interview season”)
* **Harvard** (7/10) thought it went well tbf was my third interview, and very sweet. Just a genuinely really cool experience to hear about someone’s experiences there + it was fun to learn about the school even tho it didn’t work out) 
* **Yale** (8/10 AGAIN she was so nice and kind and we both loved the arts…i was in a very humanities-esque mood this week and i think that definitely helped) 
* **Princeton** (7/10 super nice like let me know that his evaluation didn’t matter much and was just screening me for weirdness !!! i did fuck up by saying i didn’t like 100 years of solitude (which was his fave book)) 
* **Stanford** (5/10 WAS SO AWKWARD. Third rescheduling bc we were both so busy but I think I scored some brownie points by scheduling it at six am bc i was literally free no other time. But he was def a chiller!) 

**Essays**

I don’t think I can rate my essays. I wrote about my philosophy on death for my personal statement, my passion for ethics and understanding justice in my supplementals...very much like a theme of accepting ambiguity and persevering regardless idk. My PIQ's were also HORRBILE but like they worked out just fine so take this advice w grain of salt.

I will say I do think it’s good idea to find some genuine stories about yourself  aand use those to really drive the point home. some prompts just fit me better which played to my advantage, some did not. Idk this process so weird.

**Additional Information:**

Yeah like that’s my college application process wrapped up. Definitely torn between Yale, Williams, Amherst, and Stanford—but will probably go to Yale in the very end. A little sad about the Harvard and Princeton waitlist and wished I locked in a bit more rather than gallivanting around high school with boys and going to parties but like literally it’s a hedonic treadmill with colleges and that’s another thing i’d like to say which is essentially that like yeah i regret it but at the same time i don’t. I’m glad I had fun in high school and worked hard but did not make working hard my entire life because if this didn’t work it how it did i wouldn’t feel as if  i sold four years of my life away to a system that is far more broken than anyone really is willing to let on.  Like do have fun like, do go out, do go sutpid things who gaf bc this system that they set up certainly does not gaf about you.

Also a lot of these applications look impressive but truly it is not a single person who is doing them—please do not compare yourself. So much of college and decisions are defined by factors far beyond your control and it’s so completely unfair – it sells itself under this facade of meritocracy when it is anything but. All of this is not to say that it is not important to try hard—it is. but do so with the knowledge that you are fighting (unless you're from exeter or andover) a battle in which the cards are stacked so heavily against you and it is NOT your fault. 

**ALSO WARNING ABUOT UCHICAGO.**

I also genuinely thought I would get in no where regular decision and was almost about to ED2 to Uchicago after I got my deferral EA. If you want to go here, ED if you have the financial means or try to match thru QB. If it’s not ur number one choice I **strongly advise** you not to early action this school—they have five rounds of early binding (Ed2, SSEn, QB, ED1 and i think i’m forgetting one) along with two non-binding rounds. An ea acceptance is **exceedingly** rare and they want it that way. More strategic to ed to another school, REA somewhere (unles ur dream school has ea like mit then just shoot ur shot) 

But yeha that’s it!!

Please let me know if anyone wants any help w essays, writing activity lists, sat prep, etc1!! So much information is gatekept and im happy to share any knowledge or advice :)

1. Worked with a city program to help make ""service learning projects"" to help educate other teens abt mental health, sexual health, etc. Technically part of the city health department so I really talked this one up lol. Paid work, about 2 7hr shifts/month.
2. Dog-sitting. Pretty self explanatory, I did this starting in sophomore year. Paid work
3. Art- I usually draw for around an hour per day, so I decided to include this with an art portfolio. I've won a couple small awards and made art for official school events, the work program, my sitting job etc.
4. School Activity Committee- helped plan school events like prom, halloween, xmas party etc. This was an elected position and I held it junior year to senior year. Honestly one of the more fun ecs I did lol
5. Tutoring- I was chosen to be an english tutor for our schools first peer tutoring program. I tutored during senior year.
6. Family responsibilities- also pretty self explanatory. I have to be home to help cook dinner/clean etc by a certain time which did prevent me from enrolling in AP art so thats lowkey one of the reasons i included this one lol
7. DM for my D&D group- I ran my own campaign with a group of my friends from freshman-junior year, then ran oneshots. This was also a purely for-fun ec lol
8. Co-founded writing club with my homie (we were the only members but i didnt mention that)
9. Volunteering with local animal shelter

1. AP Scholar w/ Honors
2. National Hispanic Scholar
3. Published in Celebrating Art competition
4. Passed National Latin Exam Magna Cum Laude
5. National Merit Commended Scholar

**Letters of Recommendation**

1: My Latin teacher, who's known me for my whole hs career. I'd estimate like a 6 or 7/10 letter from her

2: My English teacher. This woman absolutely adores me and I chose her because she always glazes me for like four paragraphs in my report card. Probably an 8-9/10

3: Counselor. Oh my lord this woman lowkey HATED me. During junior year I had a panic attack outside her office and she went out to call me a selfish asshole while I cried 💀 however she's not bad at pretending to be nice and she wouldn't intentionally sabotage a student (she has *unintentionally* sabotaged students in the past but that's a different essay lol) so I'd give this one a solid 4/10. In happier news, she finally resigned last week!!!🥳

**Interviews**

Harvard: Went really well! The lady was super nice and we went over time by a bit.

Dartmouth: So so so awkward. This was my first interview and I was stressed as hell and it showed 💀

Smith: Eh... I think it went well? The woman who interviewed me was like seventy and she was HARSH 😭 she literally asked me why I thought I should get into smith and said being admitted to the fly in wouldn't be enough haha.. I think she liked my ECs though and in the end she told me to contact her if I wanted an internship lmfao

Princeton: Not much to say about this one, it went pretty alright but nothing crazy. Felt more like the interviewer trying to sell me on Princeton than me trying to sell Princeton on myself lol.

**Essays**

I'd say my essays were aight... I'm more of a creative writer so I tried to incorporate some of those elements in my main essay and I think that stood out somewhat (maybe not in a good way though 💀) Overall I'd say like a 7/10 for my essays though.

Wellesley has lowkey been my dream school since sophomore year and I really hope I can make the aid work out for it or Smith </3)

I'm still a little dissapointed about all the reach rejections but such is the nature of the sub-10% acceptance rate I guess ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. I'm still technically waiting on Duke but my bum ass is NOT getting in. I don't like the school that much anyway so I'm just gonna forget about it :P

I still haven't committed anywhere due to financial aid issues (my bum ahh dad got rejected from the university of employment) but I'm honestly just very thankful to be LEAVING TEXAS and going to college next fall!!!!!! (AND I have an option that would let me graduate DEBT FREE!!!!! WOOOO!!!)

I only had an interview for Middlebury which went amazingly, literally don't think it could have gone better. The guy was so nice and we had a really good chat about Middlebury and politics, it was actually quite fun. (10/10)

**Essays**

I think my essays were what really set me apart. In my main common app essay I talked about my relationship with the US, how my Grandmother moved from the south in the US to the UK in her early 20s and how that inspired me to do similar and I kind of evolved it from that base. Also for Cornell I thought my essays were really good because I developed off how I had grown up on a farm and what I'd learnt from that which I imagine is what they were looking for.

2. Executive board member for a subdivision of a grassroots social justice org
3. Spanish Honor Society board member
4. Volunteer shift lead at a museum
5. Ballet (quit midway through hs for money reasons)
6. Food service summer job
7. Started a small volunteer program at a homeless shelter
8. Science camp counselor
9. Planned a fundraiser for said social justice org
10. Misc visual and performing arts stuff that I lumped into one activity

For my UC application, I just stretched out my arts involvement and included some social media advocacy stuff rip.

**Awards/Honors**

Very weak. PVSA, National Merit Commendation, Seal of Biliteracy, AP Scholar…really scraping the bottom of the barrel. My school doesn’t really give out awards unless it’s through a specific activity.

**Letters of Recommendation**

I only asked for two LORs for some reason (actually, I know the reason, the reason was crippling social anxiety). Don‘t do this, kids! I feel weird rating them but I would estimate a 7/10 and 9/10.

**Interviews**

None ggs 

**Essays**

Upon rereading my PIQs, I can safely say they sucked! I was very anxious about being too lyrical in my responses, and this ended up biting me in the butt—all of my PIQs felt very resume-ish and technical.

My Common App essay was well executed, in my opinion and that of those who I showed it to. I wrote about a fairly niche extracurricular activity and how it pertained to my interdisciplinary interests and personal identity. I finished it over winter break, which I strongly recommend against.

I submitted an entirely different essay for my UW 650-worder about speaking another language and accepting the unfamiliarity and discomfort inherent to social justice work/community service. Frankly, it was not my best work, and it came across as purple prose-heavy to me (no pun intended). My honors essay was actually abysmal, but somehow I got in?

My supplementals were a mixed bag. Some of them were painful to reread and some of them were (imho) straight fire—all of them were written within a week of the application deadline. Again, please do NOT do this :D

**Additional Information:**

Hella extenuating circumstances in my Additional Info section...I was pretty severely ill as an underclassman and was in the ICU for a hot minute, so my freshman/sophomore GPA was like a 3.6, but I had a 4.0/5.0 junior year. I was diagnosed with a learning disability in HS, and mentioned that I only received a 504 plan for it midway through junior year. I also had some family financial and personal difficulties that made it difficult for me to participate in many ECs. 

Well, that was fun, and only cost me one whole band! /s In the end I’m headed to CC and planning to transfer to a UC unless I get off any waitlists. I would have loved to attend UW or UMass, but the OOS tuition is simply not feasible for me. Getting waitlisted and not flat out rejected from Cornell was kind of demoralizing and made me wish I had actually applied to Ivy Leagues, but unfortunately I had to pay for a lot of my application fees myself and evidently didn't carve out the best list. Anyway, I am currently writing a fire LOCI for Cornell because why not, and I'll see you guys in r/TransferToTop25 lololol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jmh3i6/instate_white_girl_gets_brutalized_by_ucs/,1743233534,1520,35,3.7,White,"UCSC (environment and sustainability studies), UW Seattle (engineering) + $3000 scholarship + honors college, UMass Amherst (computational linguistics) + $16000 scholarship","Northeastern (computer science and sustainability), UC Irvine (civil engineering), UC Davis (civil engineering), Cal Poly SLO (civil engineering), Cornell (CALS environment/sustainability) ???

**Interviews**

**Essays**

Okay. All my essays carried me (especially for my reaches). My counselor told me to strongly consider community college when I told him the schools I wanted to attend were UT Austin, USC, UCLA, and NYU (yes, I know they’re all reaches with my stats). So, I created essays where the reader can read my essay and be left feeling something. 

Personal Statement: talked about different films (Barbie, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Black Swan) and how they connect to my life -- answering the question of What was i made for? 

* Poorly described the essay here, however, a lot of people read it and were left shocked. Worked with a personal college consultant to create this essay + essays for 5 other schools. 

Others: Focused on telling a story. How do my experiences shape my thinking? And how does my thinking align with my future? What skills am I missing to be successful? How can XYZ College nurture these skills? Used these questions to guide my essays. Also focused on connecting my heritage/culture with my morals -- how my culture which I deemed beautiful did not align with my views towards abortions/women's rights. Talked about how this caused me to question my beliefs.

**Interviews**

*stanford:* *my first one. interviewer was rly sweet! however, i overprepared in a way and was trying to speak out memorized polished sentences. didn't feel like it helped my app.*

*duke: interviewer was very friendly and chill. felt like a genuine conversation. i felt more naturally prepared and very comfortable the entire time. i think i got all my points across coherently and made a good impression.*

*harvard: interviewer was nice, but very strict on time. ended right at the 30-min mark rip, and i didn't get to ask them any questions. actually felt like an interview. was lowkey anxious and stuttered/rambled for some questions, so i don't think i made the best impression.*

**Essays**

wrote a pretty reflective personal statement. only my fam members read it, and they all commented how the topic/story heavily resonates with and showcases my values in life.

supplementals/PIQs were mainly about my commitment to fostering inclusive communities, parents struggling with confusing interface design, personal experiences with AAPI advocacy, love for interdisciplinary studies, and baking!

***Closing Thoughts***

i still feel like i'm dreaming as i'm writing this LOL. never in my wildest, wildest dream could i have expected these results when i first began the college process—esp after getting straight-up rejected by my first decision (stanford). i genuinely have no idea how or why i was selected from such a competitive applicant pool this year to these amazing colleges, but i cannot be more grateful and know that i will fully take advantage of all the resources and opportunities these schools could potentially provide. right now, i'm quite torn between brown and harvard. brown was my initial top choice, as ive heard they have a happy learning environment, but harvard is harvard, so any insights about either would be appreciated!

i think my biggest advice i'd give to future applicants is to understand that your application is holistically evaluated. i definitely don't have the best tests scores or most impressive ec's IMO, but after rereading my stanford app, i realized it would be hard for an admissions reader to grasp a firm grip on who i was as a person and how i'll contribute/thrive on campus. hence, during the RD round, for every activity i included on my app and passion i expressed in my essays, i ensured they tied to a primary trait i wanted to highlight about myself (which in my case, was my consideration for others), and it def worked!

as for those who are feeling discouraged or devasted regarding their decision results, i'm praying those feelings will turn around soon! college isn't the sole determinant of the trajectory of our futures, and i'm positive we’ll all thrive in our own ways—each with our unique strengths and on our own timelines :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jmeepi/stanford_rea_reject_who_ultimately_couldnt_be/,1743222308,1510,,3.867423997,Asian,"uiuc (EA), ut austin (EA), umich (EA), uw seattle, ucsd, uci, ucla, brown??!!, harvard???!!!!, Waiting on:*, duke (will update in a few days), Closing Thoughts***","cmu (scs), berkeley, Acceptances*, uiuc (EA), ut austin (EA), umich (EA), uw seattle, ucsd, uci, ucla, brown??!!, harvard???!!!!, Waiting on:*, duke (will update in a few days), Closing Thoughts***",stanford (REA),Male

1jme3tg,Quirky PNW Interdisciplinary Music and STEM Kid is (mostly) happy,"My college application journey is kind of complicated as I applied for music performance and STEM double majors, meaning I had to send in pre-screens and audition in person. That means I get two decisions for each school, one for the school itself and one for the program (kinda like direct to major CS or ECE). This led to some split decisions… Overall I’m really happy with my decisions, it’s nothing incredible, but really happy. Also help me decide where I should commit!

**Letters of Recommendation**

English Teacher: 8/10– have a good relationship with him, he’s definitely a character and doesn’t write LORs for a lot of people, his letter was an interesting read for sure as he is very kooky

Physics Teacher: 7/10– he is so awesome, is a super new teacher (second year teaching), and I think he likes me and wrote a pretty good letter, but maybe not the most personalized 

Choir Teacher: 10/10– have had her three years, I work directly with her frequently to plan things for our music program, she is a close mentor and I know she wrote a excellent rec

**Interviews**

 Yale: 5/10– had a good conversation but really didn’t have any common interests, so most of the time was spent on her talking about Yale and me talking about my school. At some point the conversation lulled and she just got up and left 💀
​
Harvard: 8/10– made me so excited about Harvard! I talked about specific things that set me apart from other applicants as an interdisciplinary music and science student, and projects that I’ve been working on. We connected over music and she was really enthusiastic and seemed like she actually cared.

**Essays**
Personal Statement: Structured it as “a triad: music, physics and me.” Combined specific anecdotes about finding community in choir, discovering how physics can describe sound phenomena, and talking about how those discoveries helped me through a rough transition in my life. Pretty unique I think, I tried to really emphasize how important studying both music and academics is to me. The weird structure could have come off as either pretentious or creative, but I’m proud of it :)

Supplementals: Common topics included living in Ecuador for 4 years, transferring high schools mid-year, choir of community, highlighting my interdisciplinary-ness, or having long curly hair as a “guy.” If I had visited the school or had an event with them I mentioned that. Most of them pretty strong, tried to infuse them with personality, but some might have been a been overwrought or convoluted.

**Auditions:**
Brief side note for auditions as I was applying many places for performance in addition to STEM—I sent in audition tapes to most places…they were pretty good. I’m a good musician, and quite good for a HS singer, but not anything spectacular (I’ve only had lessons for a year or so). I auditioned in person at UO, USC, and CMU, and the rest were online. 

**College Decisions** (all scholarship are per year, and merit, as I don’t qualify for need-based)

**Additional Information:**
Overall, I’m so happy with my college process and decisions. It’s been such a stressful experience but I’m so glad that I have really awesome options at the end of the road. HELP ME DECIDE WHERE TO COMMIT!! My top two choices are USC and CMU—USC has an excellent program for music and is super social, but more lacking for STEM, as well as being in SoCal which is too hot for me 😭😭, CMU has my dream program, but I’ve heard that the stress culture is huge and that people are generally anti-social. Drop a response if you have any thoughts!!

**Letters of Recommendation**

ngl i dont know how someone could rate their LORs without seeing them but

Magazine Advisor - 10/10. He's written multiple LORs for me (and I've read them). Had him for all years for Journalism. He's seen me grow not only as a student, but a person. lowkey my second dad

AP Lang Teacher - 8/10. no idea, except i know he probably glazed me judging from the way i asked for a graded essay to submit to programs and the comments he wrote were so extra LMFAOOO. he advises like 3 of the activities i'm involved with as well.

Summer Program Professor - 7/10??  in our grade reports he wrote that ""my contributions to the program were second to none"" so maybe it wasn't so bad

**Interviews**

*UPenn - 6/10* they're fake and my lady was awkward but cool

*Swarthmore* \- *8/10* vibed hard af with the student. said she wished she wasn't graduating next year so she could be closer with me so woo

*Princeton* \- *10/10*. wow. by far, the best interview i had. he was thoroughly impressed by my story and activities. said he wished he had me in his classroom, that i was the type of student he looks for when teaching, and that he could've spoken to me for an extra 3 hours.

*Yale - 9/10*. i think i could've expressed more about my academics but like princeton, he was impressed by my background and the way i articulated myself. nothing much about it, but i enjoyed my conversation with him and hope he's doing well. also i was not expecting to get a yale interview at all + got one 1 week after the deadline too

**Essays**

ngl idk LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOO. they were fine, could've been better with more time, start early guys. proud of my supplementals though.

**Additional Information:**

waiting on duke but yolo. yeah my academics sucked but my upward trajectory kinda gave me hope. ap exams also would've gone better but i had a thyroid cancer scare during them + fainted multiple times but oh well who gaf.  
i knew i was going to get rejected everywhere judging from my gpa, but the waitlists were a nice surprise and cornell and dartmouth were just weohirfwouiehflwisduchlwiuef (don't ask me how i got into them over rutgers hc and a w&m waitlist). i read multiple books regarding higher education and college, to the point where i began getting desensitized to the admissions process as a whole and i think that's why i took them well. stanford was the only one that really hurt me for some reason but time will pass. most likely choosing pomona over cornell and dartmouth just because of pricing (both ivies are 45k a year for me), the student cultures, preprofessionalism, etc.

He introduced me to do research and have been talking a lot with me about colleges/research/engineering. His son just graduated from my high school and got in Cornell and he's willing to do anything to help me get into decent universities and he told me (this sounds weird but it's true) that he wrote a really good rec letter for me.

My mentor at local university: he's really prestigious in ECE stuff. I think he liked me when I was doing research with his students at the lab (or hopefully). 8/10

Calculus teacher: 8/10 She loves me and can talk about my math competitions and stuff.

English teacher: she's impressed by my reading and writing skills as a non-naive speaker, we didn't have a lot of conversations but the rec letter is not going to be bad, 7.5/10

Reflections:

I don’t know why I even applied to these schools considering how low my GPA and SAT and ACT was. I had weak course rigor compared to other people at my school, lack of leadership roles, and very weak awards when others had national level awards 💀. Even people with lower stats than me got in better schools, so I think my essays and recs ended up screwing me over. In retrospect, I think I let my SSP acceptance get to my head and I ended up getting humbled. While it hurt, I’m incredible grateful that I got into Purdue and UCSD and now I’m deliberating between the two choices. I’m also holding out hope for my waitlists, so we’ll see. To future applicants: please don’t be arrogant  and delusional like me and set realistic expectations.

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

Not in any particular order tbh

1. Artist - District art show, both 10th and 12th (school requires students to be enrolled in an art class). Also, appearance at the HS art/music show. I basically just included this at my advisor's, well, advice. Ranked it as last because, yeah. I've also done some commissioned work over the years, both online and in person. Talked about my mediums and my general types of work. - All 4 years (continuing)
2. I had a few volunteering things that, tbh I'm too lazy to write them all out. A variety of roles from project leader, member, in-person, and online volunteer work. Includes cards for children, transcribing, helping out an elementary school principal, AXS Map project and working on my hometown's accessibility map (previously blank), lead writer of a lesson plan for elementary students about the Great Migration for APUSH. - 3 years (from Sophomore yr) (continuing community involvement wherever I end up)
3. Older sibling core caretaking for younger siblings. Had to do this a lot. Like 11 hrs a week a lot. She's easy to handle, but you know, you can't leave a child alone in a house. - All 4 years (continuing, less regular basis)
4. Member of a local non-profit college access program. weekly seminars, connected service completions, and gave a presentation highlighting accessibility issues at an assigned college. - Junior/Senior
5. Video Game Addon Website founder (free btw) - I basically make 3D models, texture said models, and then do some coding and exporting magic to make them work in a couple of different video games. I mainly focus on railroad simulators (an interest I touch on in some of my supplements as well). I also designed and created the website, run the related Discord server where people usually need assistance with the addons, and run advertising on social media through posts, but also newsletter-style videos as well. Which takes a lot of time to do. I have also handled a collaborative project with another website that does similar add-ons. One of my main 2 ECs. - Summer b4 Junior Year to Senior Year (continuing)
6. Freelance 3D Artist - Basically, I do kind of the above but for money, and there's also a more professional portfolio development to it as I also work on some non-locomotive projects for this. I have a steady clientele that I've been told often recommends me to their friends as well. Also you could not believe the customer service skills I had to learn for this. My other main EC. I used some pieces as part of my art school portfolio. - 3 years (sophomore gap) (continuing).
7. filled with service (see #2)
8. filled with service (see #2)
9. filled with service (see #2)

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. AP with WE Service Recognition
2. AP Scholar
3. High Honor Roll (All 4 years)
4. yeah tbh I should have done Scholastic Keys
5. probably would have had AP Scholar with Distinction if college apps were after senior year (exams are soon, Im scared)

**Letters of Recommendation**

1.) My AP Art Hist. Teacher. Strong relationship. Had previously written a letter of recommendation for me the previous spring for summer programs. We met and talked about any achievements or accomplishments I've done for him to incorporate. I rate this one a 9/10.

2.) My Art Teacher/Visual Arts Department Head. Had her for 2 classes Sophomore year, and then kept up with her during Junior year (had to fulfill STEM/health requirements), and then Senior Year started the Indp. Study as mentioned above. She has seen the bulk of my artistic growth, and we've been very close throughout the last 3 years, so I give this one an 8/10, just because we didn't have a discussion like above. I overall thought her letter showcased my artistic growth.

I probably should have asked my Algebra 2 teacher, but wtv what's done is done.



**Interviews**

Harvard: I think I did decently? I asked some thought-provoking questions at the end, and I think my answers to his questions were decently structured. Although his kid kept interrupting every 5 minutes lol. 7.5/10  
  
Dartmouth: This was for sure my best interview, and also my first! We had a lovely conversation to the point we almost ran out of time in our Zoom room. 9/10



**Essays**

My main essay took about 2 weeks to write in June before my junior year ended. In the fall, I had my college advisor (through a local non-profit) read over my essay, and we revised it for clarity and a more narrative focus. I still go back and get teary-eyed at it, so it's a solid 9.5/10. I wrote for the gratitude prompt and connected it to my art.

Supplements: Mixed bag, overall they were great, particularly my Ivy ones (written early Jan). I did however write all of these the day they were due, so. There were a few duds, like my BC one, where I talked about rising about stereotypes of my hometown that I look back on and then shrivel in cringe. I'd like to highlight the supplement that got me into Trinity, where I talked about, and told a little story about my queerness and growing up being asked ""why are all of your friends girls?"" and how I'd build bridges etc etc.

Ivy Overall: 8.5/10  
Others: 8/10

**Additional Information:**

Reminder for admit-by-major schools, I applied Visual Arts. 

I forgot to do Browns video :(

My school makes it super hard to plan scheduling, like seriously wdym there were 3 AP options sophomore year but you had to specially request for the 3rd option. Also there was an accelerated math summer program only offered to one middle school??? what the hell. I actually got set up there.

Transfer Plans (Draft 1) (For transferring my Sophomore yr)  
\-> CC and do Precalc/Calc1 this summer, maybe a Spanish course as well. Also looking into their short winter term as a possibility. Also considering CLEP for Precalc instead.

\-> Lock in at MassArt, build connections with profs, possibly look into any community based projects I could propose/join. Haven't gotten too far into this yet but I'd like to continue doing community-based work.  
\-> Continue to support the Class of 26 in college applications w/ my HS, my counselor has talked with me about possibly helping prospective Art students with understanding/planning for art school applications. (No one in the counseling staff has experience there, apparently?) Also continuing to run a small college access Instagram page, where I do free essay reviews/revisions and help create study plans/schedules.   
\-> Looking into this still, but considering another SAT retake if scores required by the institution.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lang Teacher - 9/10. We had a really good relationship and she knows my academic interests very well! I think this rec really spoke to my ✨ intellectual vitality ✨

AP Physics 1 Teacher - 7.5/10. Probably on the more generic side but we had a good relationship and he probably discussed my communication/writing skills within STEM. Also talked about how I regained my confidence in STEM after a setback in sophomore year.

APUSH Teacher - 8/10. Had him freshman year when I was a lazy procrastinator (I still am 😭) and again in APUSH junior year. I think he really spoke to my growth (particularly in the intellectual realm) and my research interests in Linguistics and how I plan to pursue a PhD (which I spoke to him about)

Piano Teacher - 8.5/10. Used only for schools that accept multiple supplemental recs. She spoke about my impact on the Chinese community and how she's seen me mature through the years both musically and as a person.

**Interviews**

Yale - 9/10. when i got the interview request i was genuinely shocked. went completely unhinged on supps and wrote about male pregnancy.

Stanford - 8.5/10. he said i was a good fit for stanford and we talked a lot about intellectual/personal freedom in college.

**Essays**

Common App - 8.5/10. I think the premise + contents are good but the writing could've been a bit better. i basically talked about the idea of brilliance using glow as a metaphor and how my view on being brilliant has changed through my personal experiences (e.g. being told I couldn't succeed in a STEM career, learning about gender bias in AI, my old scientific idol Marie Curie whose brilliance killed her). it was a VERY dense essay but i think the metaphor tied everything together and showed my inexpressible fascination with language + STEM

Cornell Supplements - 7/10. i honestly didn't really like them. the a2c essay was funny but in hindsight i wish i wrote about a different topic (😭). the CAS essay was really hard to write for whatever reason but i managed to crank it out on the last day. i think what might've made it stand out was connecting things back to a famous Chinese linguist who went to Cornell that i wrote a research paper on and how i strived to emulate him in the 21st century.

Stanford Supplements - ???/10. i think i showed a good fit for symsys in the first essay by talking about a paper i read that connected synesthesia and AI. for the distinctive contributions to stanford essay i took a HUGE risk and talked about my experience with academic fraud growing up in singapore + china due to the high stakes environment. i mentioned the recent cases of fraud at stanford (yikes) and how i viewed these controversies not as stains but as an opportunity for stanford to lead discussions around academic integrity, and how i'd start a club at stanford that would discuss these cases. i also mentioned addressing fraud with compassion AND discipline in the 5 things that are important to you essay.

overall, i definitely feel like my supps were a lot better at showing my personality (especially Brown and Yale's).

**Final Thoughts**

holy shit the college admissions process was an emotional ROLLERCOASTER. i'm a serial procrastinator and cranking out college apps really forced me to confront my weaknesses and fix them in some ways while also embracing myself in others.

in my sophomore year, my aunt was diagnosed with cancer and my parents flew back to China to take care of her + my grandparents, which left me alone at home for weeks at a time. for privacy i won't say more but it definitely affected my ability to do schoolwork + ECs and i struggled heavily with feelings of neglect.

senior year was also absolute hell for me- i pretty much lost all motivation after 1st quarter closed and ended up getting a HORRIBLE grade in my vhs class 2nd quarter. my teachers were all really kind and accommodating which i'm honestly not sure i deserve, alongside these amazing college results, but you know what? i'm going to take it!

what i think helped me stand out were probably 3 major factors:

\- niche major (linguistics) with ECs and awards all themed around it

\- research background

\- family background (born in China -> lived in Singapore for 3 years -> now in the US)

during the early round, i didn't really take advantage of the last 2 points to make a cohesive narrative. in fact i barely even mentioned growing up in china and singapore- something i deeply regret because it's definitely central to how i started loving language. i also had a way weaker, less personal essay that was essentially a long ""Why Major"" essay and i used it because i thought AOs needed to see i had a clear plan/direction moving forward. DO NOT DO THIS! your voice and story are EXTREMELY important and the priority of your common app essay - anything else can be explained in additional info and through counselor recs.

when writing essays, i tried to re-use supps as little as possible. i would reference the same anecdote in my life for a lot of colleges but focus on a different aspect/takeaway of that experience for each prompt. to all the underclassmen lurking: MAKE A LORE SHEET. any time something interesting happens to you or you learn a lesson, write it down!! it'll help you with college apps but also just give you the opportunity to reflect, which i think is so important. i'm going to run the risk of sounding like one of those people who somehow attained nirvana through the college app process, but reflection is truly the catalyst to personal growth.

another thing: let go of your expectations. i know it's easy for me to say this now that i'm on the other side, but this was my mindset throughout the entire process. of course the part of me that craves validation and love wanted AOs to find me quirky and see me for my potential, but it's unreasonable to *expect* anyone to find that je ne sais quoi in you. don't shape your decisions, where you apply, and how you present yourself around others' expectations. once you eliminate external variables and focus on the things within your control, i promise things will work out.

my biggest tip for fellow procrastinators: SET YOURSELF DEADLINES!!! i did not start writing RD supps until christmas break and while this isn't something i necessarily regret because i liked my essays, this approach is definitely not going to work for everyone. i recommend getting your essays read by another person and setting a hard deadline of 1 week before the actual deadline to send them the essay so you can get feedback. outsourcing your deadlines to other people is always more effective than setting deadlines of your own.

this is getting extremely long but at the end of the day, the college app process is different for everyone - that's what i love about the US system, that everyone is inherently unique. follow your own path and don't get swayed by others!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jmb44c/a2c_community_supplement_bags_cornell/,1743211339,1590,,3.916160284,East Asian,,UCSD - Accepted????

My top top school was Purdue , but obviously I was waitlisted so I can't do much about that, but my primary issue now, is deciding between Montana State and Rutgers. With the scholarship, I can go through all 4 yrs at MSU and pay the rest out of pocket and come out debt free, but I'd come out of Rutgers with around ~80k in debt. I love love both campuses, but Im having trouble deciding between the schools.

Additional Information:

I moved to the U.S. in 5th grade without speaking a word of English, which made for an interesting first year. I grew up in Japan before that. Robotics became my thing when I found competitive robotics when I was 10, and since then, I’ve been chasing every opportunity to build something cool.

I thought I was cooked when my father's visa expired and we had to go back to Japan; international asking for aid is tough, and I was on the verge of losing my hope until I received an external, full-ride scholarship from a corporate-based foundation.

I was very stressed out when I was deferred from Purdue and UMich, as I saw many of my peers get into those schools. So, I was so shocked and relieved when I started getting into great schools later on in EA/RD rounds.

Now, I have to decide between Berkeley, Northwestern, UMich, and GT. All are great schools, but I am leaning towards Berkeley rn because of its strong engineering program and its location, as I am formerly a Bay Area resident. This entire process has been a rollercoaster, but I’m so grateful for where I ended up. Excited for the future!

I separated activity 2 and 3 because 2 was a job, 3 was volunteering

I'm incredibly grateful for both the acceptances and even the waitlists I received; I honestly expected far more rejections. I initially procrastinated on applying until the RD round because I felt my essays were weak and hoped to strengthen other parts of my application (though nothing really changed lol). I saw UCSD and UCLA as fantastic options and genuinely thought I’d end up at one of them after having a streak of rejections/waitlists. But today, Michigan came in clutch. I haven't fully committed to UM yet, but I'll most likely be heading there. It's been my dream school since I immigrated to America when I was 8, and Bryce Underwood needs some receivers.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Physics teacher – 5/10 – got good grades, participated in class and office hrs & helped other students, didn’t really connect on personal level

AP lang teacher – 3/10 – consistently wrote good essays and participated in class in class, wrote a list of essay quotes & reading quotes that I wanted to highlight, but also didn’t connect personally

**Interviews**

MIT – 5/10 – was 1.5 hrs, discussed issues of morality & social norms, came across as a really structural & methodical person. Didn’t really mention my most important ECs enough, also forgot to write a thank you note.

Smith – 7/10 – I loved my interviewer and she followed the exact postgrad & career path I’d love to, expressed good reasons for why I wanted to go, etc. Only 30 mins though bc of time limit.

CMU School of Art – 5/10 – the professor that talk to we abt our art for \~10 mins seemed unamused. Managed to come up w a lot of random questions in conversation with school of art director of admissions afterwards tho.

Yale – 6/10 – she said I wasn’t a bad conversationalist, but I don’t think I opened up enough. Talked about my ECs and she said that she’s like me in some ways. Time limited to \~45 minutes.

Harvard – 3/10 – a complete uncook. For the first half of the interview, I had just woken up from a nap and said the most random disjointed stuff. Sorta recovered at the end, but damage in the lack of eloquentness was already done.

**Essays**

I spent a lot of time revising my essays, supplementals felt like on average 8/10. Feel free to ask about specific schools & prompts in comments.

Personal statement – 3/10 – Was p risky, talked about how I was a very bitter / angry kid due to family influences and then how I independently learned to live harmoniously, be a good person, and follow social norms while still retaining a strong character to stand up for myself & other people. Honestly rereading it seemed a little stylistically / tonally weak. The reflection part also had to be cut down a lot, so not very well executed. I don’t think this essay helped me a lot and should’ve been rewritten.

UC PIQs – 7/10?

* Leadership – Learned from disagreeing w one of my co-officer’s decisions to be a more tolerant leader. 
* Community – Improving art club to be more active & subsequently used art to improve school spirit.
* Talent – Standing up for my team during sports thing, my talent is advocacy and sense of justice. It was one of my best essays but I never reused it! 
* \#8 – Experiencing gender imparities in tech & efforts to improve it.

**Reflection**

>!I’m a little sad because I didn’t get into any of my personal top choices (Berkeley, CMU, MIT), and I can go into a long rant about why that didn’t happen. Still fairly satisfied with the outcome, but still a bit disappointed. Caltech admitted me because of my art portfolio, they mentioned it in my physical acceptance letter (don't really know how to feel about this). Maybe my acceptances were based on whether the AOs were able to see through the poor execution of my personal statement and understand how anger can be a superpower. For Columbia, it might've been a good fit especially with all the activist culture but I do think my Ivy supplementals were equal in quality. If I were to change anything, it would've definitely been revising my personal statement more lol.!<

Though I don’t think I’m really in the position to give advice, I’ll just leave you with this:

* Find your ""third place."" I found working in the house pretty distracting and it was too convenient to start wasting time, so I pretty much spent afternoons after school and all of winter break at the library where it was easier to focus.
* Prioritizing mental health. If you are depressed, you will be unproductive. Then you will be stressed because you are unproductive. Then it will exacerbate your mental health problems. For me, some triggers are family & low sleep, so I avoided those as much as possible.

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. AP CSA: 7/10, knew him pretty well! I visit his class and am asked to tutor this one girl in algebra one during my free periods and or gym--excused, of course! Super sweet, helped me with this entire process. (Submitted everywhere)
2. APUSH: 7/10, knew him very well! My UPENN essay went to him, helped me discover that grades and what not aren't everything! Really did develop a sense of self and who I want to be as a person aside from career. (Submitted everywhere)
3. T30 Uni Mentor #2 EC: 8/10, spoke about my skill and work! We worked a lot together and we still message time to time! Really hoped to be able to go said T30 uni but no luck, still seeing him this summer while I work!  (Submitted everywhere)
4. T30 Summer Program Director: 8/10, I've seen previous recc letters she's written--insane woman, works hard and plays hard. She's my inpso, she helped me do a lot of self discovery into enginnering, forever grateful. (Submitted only to JHU and another school)
5. College Counselor: 5/10, we knew each other briefly and got to know each other. Gave him a lot to work with in terms of info about me! He even called my ED school to vouch for me but that's after we began speaking more. Can't really say much.

**LOCI Updates**

1. I now utilize APIs to categorize and analyze the locations of incidents. In cases where the API lacks precision, I manually refine the data to ensure accuracy. Through this work, I have improved my understanding of regression analysis, which I am currently applying to identify trends and correlations. Furthermore, I began learning LaTeX to improve my ability to write professional research papers.
2. Developed a Hummingbird attendee tracker, designing a system to track attendance using hardware sensors. I am exploring facial recognition and student ID scanning to improve its efficiency.
3. Led several community service initiatives as Honor Society President and Vice President for Student Government, including:
   * Organizing a Toy drive that has collected 30+ donations.
   * Raised over $1,000 in 2024 for X awareness, Y, and Z for children in need. Additionally, as part of my efforts to support my school community, I helped reduce the senior trip cost by one hundred dollars (e.g: 150 to 50), making it more accessible for students at our Title I school.
   * We have significantly increased student engagement in financial literacy by collaborating with financial aid counselors and expanding participation in school events. Our outreach on affording college has reached over 500+ students, with 400+ consistently engaging.
4. Invited former Deputy Attorney General of New Jersey, Deputy Legal Director of the National Organization for Women (NOW), and Legal Director of the ACLU of Mississippi, to speak in my class, building discussions on gender equality in STEM, civic engagement and leadership. 
5. I took on the position as summer program Ambassador, extending from my summer program, to support incoming participants with hands-on research guidance and mentorship. By sharing the insights I gained—from designing experiments to collaborating with peers.
6. Improved my academic performance in advanced coursework: I jumped directly into AP Physics 1 and AP Calculus AB, despite my school's usual requirement to take Honors Physics first and meet other academic thresholds before enrolling. Currently, I hold a 97 in AP Physics and a 95 in AP Calculus AB. (INFO, NOT ACTUAL IN LOCI)

**Letters of Recommendation**

IB chem teacher - haven't read it but I think it's really good

IB english teacher - pretty good and talks about my growth a lot but she really glazes me and it's a little off-putting

IB math teacher - probably bad, he told me that he got like a 500 in SAT english so I don't think he knows how to write

bike shop owner - decent and proves that I actually did a good job with my volunteer work

**Interviews**

no interviews

**Essays**

personal statement - really really good, tied with my SAT as the best part of my application. I wrote it about going down a wikipedia rabbit hole and learning about these three incan mummies who were killed as kids. moral of the story is that the kids never had the chance to learn or be curious because of their fates, whereas I can take advantage of all these wonderful tools for learning (like college) and appreciate how awesome the world is.

diversity essay - this one's hard for me because I'm a wealthy white american. I talked about the bike shop I volunteered at and how working with refugees/homeless people who are way different from me actually made us connect with each other more. so it was less about how I am diverse and more about diversity in general but pretty decent.

why engineering - this was a good essay, I talked about an egg drop experiment I did as a little kid and how it showed me that just being good at math couldn't help me out in the real world since my egg drop failed miserably. rather, you need engineering to actually get things done.

community essay - I wrote about Pokémon GO and how that community connects me with people who I would never imagine talking to of all different ages, demographics, etc.

hyperfixation essay - this one was really good, I wrote about reconstructing dead languages and how interdisciplinary linguistics can be.

**Additional Information:**

I am happy with most of my results, currently leaning toward either GT or OSU. I was hoping I could nab one of the ivies, but it did not work out. I feel like my grade drop likely impacted a lot of my decisions. I am also diagnosed with OCD, which made it difficult to balance my extracurriculars, college applications, and classes. I wish I had not taken on such a heavy senior-year courseload, but it is what it is.

*(Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

keyboard teacher (7/10): THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD we’re like best friends i wrote the other lor descriptions yesterday im too lazy to make this one long but this said a lot about music and stuff. ngl i shouldve put music higher but its whatever

business teacher (5/10): pretty average summary of hte stuff ive done and said i was good in class and stuff. but im not doing business anymore so didn’t use this

ap calc ab teacher (?/10): okay so i didn’t read this but yeah although she wrote this near the start of the year, we were besties from the start. we make fun of each other all the time and yap. stem background, and i was doing really well in the class from the start. hopefully it was personal enough but i lwk trust her. idk why but in her class i feel so Normal and seen in a good way. favorite teacher this year and i participate a lot even if i get the answer wrong 

ap seminar/research teacher (?/10): didn’t read this either but i also really trust her. so amazingly understanding about my accommodations. she knows some personal stuff about me and is so considerate and i feel like i did really did connect with her. i did good in the class too i think

**Interviews**

* harvard (9/10): this was SO GOOD i felt like i had really good answers to most of the questions and we yapped and we kept talking until even after we got out the door. i researched a lot and was extremely prepared. 
* duke (6/10): he seemed so nice but bro we kept trying to talk at the same time and i kept interrupting this guy on accident i felt so like arrogant BUT I DIDNT MEAN IT he seemed cool though similar major to me

**Essays**

* old personal statement (-9999/10): talked about losing student council election and immigrant parents and being autistic and finding my voice this was the most cliche shit ever

* other topics i discussed:
   * why major (8/10): linked my misophonia to premed and talked about accessibility devices and research
   * leadership 1 (5/10): talked about being exhibit team leader and the importance of incorporating everyones view
   * leadership 2 (6/10): talked about being co-leader in gsa and lgbtq+ advocacy as well as the importance of queer community.

**Additional Information:**

i’m starting college at 16. im ngl i couldve benefitted so much from an extra year i dont think anyones ready for college but im afraid im too emotionally immature / unstable. don’t graduate early kids.

also i chose specifically not to talk about depression / anxiety in my application. i thought that + my trauma were too risky even though it’s some of the most important things about me. idk if i regret it or not. but tbf my depression / anxiety were significantly influenced over college applications. i was too optimistic i was trying to make a good application since freshman year but i only googled what i needed to get this year LOL my ecs/awards are just not on par i fear

should’ve applied more targets i would def like more options. also regret not really looking into LACs because i feel like those would really fit me. my cousin went to williams college and my mom thought it was a “no name school” 😭😭 its whateverrr

i know i will be happy wherever i end up though even if im disappointed (in myself) rn <3

OH ALSO i took a lot of business classes and i was originally going to go into business or math the decision to go into engineering premed was like really recent lol maybe i cooked myself who knows",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jm60ra/16_year_old_queer_asian_and_neurodivergent_rd/,1743196904,1520,,4,Asian,,,"jhu (RD), ucla (RD), georgetown (RD) applied biology, usc (RD), rice (i cried over this for 1 hour and 31 minutes and had an existential crisis) (RD), wooster (RD) probably withdrawing so im just putting this here, harvard (RD), uc berkeley (RD), umich (RD), Waiting:*",Male

**Essays**

I definitely think my essays carried me, so don’t be afraid to talk about whatever you think will carry and explain who you are as a person. I had a berkeley admissions officer read over mine, helping me and giving feedback, so network your skills to get help from everyone, but don’t change up your writing too much to accommodate everyone. 

First PIQ i wrote about my job at Autozone, starting as a 16 year old girl who knew nothing about cars working in a male dominated field

Second PIQ i wrong about why i want to major in psychology, while not receiving help from a psychiatrist or getting access to help motivated me to pursue the path of being a psychiatrist as my career. (i think talking about what your goals are and your future plans/thinking ahead really helped with convincing why I deserve to major in what I want to major since I never got offered for my alternative major in any school)

Third PIQ i talked about how my school had a controversy and was known as the most racist school in america. i talked about how that impacted me being in leadership, and why my freshman year i failed a class and did so bad. that’s why my gpa is so low. I turned around and became a straight a student after, showing my resilience and picking myself up after failing miserably my first year. (my most controversial essay, many warned me not to do it but my berkeley ao said to do it)

Fourth PIQ i talked about how daydreaming was a coping mechanism on pursuing who i want to be (imagined myself as an exec officer freshman year so senior year I am one, imagined being a link crew leader, now I am one. daydreamed about going to regional finals for wrestling and I did my sophomore year)

Basically, if you’re a student who wants to go to in state schools/public schools who isn’t doing the best academically, DO NOT GIVE UP!! I have the most ok academics compared to other students, don’t lose hope!! I got into so many good schools compared to students who do better than me academically, so please exercise your ability to do extracurriculars, write good essays, and don’t let your GPA determine who you are. My outcome was not what I was expecting, and i thought i would’ve received waitlists for most of my schools and multiple rejection. I’m blessed to have only received one, and the thought of MAYBE attending Berkeley makes me proud of my comeback. 

I wish the best of luck to future classes, and congratulations to many of those who got into schools they wanted, or really any school!!

1jm0ch2,I'm so confused,I got accepted to big schools like harvard mit and ucla and I honestly dont understand how so many people more qualified than me got rejected.  For reference i believe my stats were really good (4.9w gpa and completed an associate's degree for biological sciences at my local cc) and although I was very passionate about my ec's and got pretty high awards for them but I didnt have many of them in comparison to others. My demographics and life is without many struggles but heavily shaped by moving across 6 countires so that may helped but in comparison to these sweats i feel like a big ahh bum. Can schools really discern people that really care and can make an impact for their school is is it really just that random?,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jm0ch2/im_so_confused/,1743182433,,,,Unknown,,,,Unknown

1jlv1c8,Results for a little rural white girl,"Hello! This one is pretty boring bc I applied to 11 safeties, 1 target, and 1 reach. Why did I do this? Self-doubt is why. College apps are timely and expensive, and I only applied to my one reach as a joke. I also thought that the top schools were super expensive for everyone so only the rich could afford it. I now know that this isn’t always true, only sometimes. For any juniors out there, have  little more faith in yourself because anything is possible.  

Demographics: 
White
Female
Rural
MD resident
Both my parents have masters
~190k a year household income
Biochem major

Stats: 
1/120 for HS class (probably will be valedictorian) 
4.48/4 W gpa (4.0 UW)
8 APs (all 5s) also Early college student so I have a lot of community college credits. Will graduate with an Associates of Science
1510 SAT. Took it once and that little gnat in my brain told me a I couldn’t do better so I didn’t it again. It’s another one of my regrets. To any juniors- try it again. You’ll regret not giving it your best shot. Same with the PSAT!!! I didn’t know that it mattered for National merit/ scholarships. I didn’t care about or study for it so I only got a 1300 😭😭😭. IT MATTERS. 

ECs:
Tri-sport athlete, and moderately successful for all three. Not good enough for D1 or recruiting for top schools. Have leadership positions on these teams. 

Lots of Tutoring: Middle School students in math, science, and writing. College students in Biology and Chemistry. Most notebly tho, I tutored English Language Learning students bc I’m proficient in Spanish. I actually centered my essay around this experience bc my role often went beyond that of a tutor. It also taught be a lot about myself and just how unwelcoming the community I grew up in can be. 

Other community service: humane society, athletic boosters (food service), church volunteering, and being an official for youth sports. 

I’m big on pet and house sitting. This is just a little side gig but I love pets so I’ll always have this little “business.” 

I’m also apart of multiple school clubs; leadership in all of them. 

Little Research project on Theology. I didnt it but it’s important because it helped me work through my identity as a Christian and part of the LGBTQ community. It also was used to explain my love for research and why I want to spend my entire life learning. 

awards 
Maryland Seal of Biliteracy
AP Scholar with Distinction
AP capstone Diploma
Distinguished Honor Role
Carson Scholarship Nominee

LORs
I think that my teachers really like me, and I chose the teachers that  I had really connected with. This is probably one of the strongest part of my application besides my essay. 

Results
Accepted into all the safeties; most notably was a good bit of merit money from Salisbury and Waynesburg. 

Target- FULL- RIDE to UMD whoop whoop!!! :-) I was super surprised about this bc I felt liked my lack of scientific research or an internship really took my out of the running. I’m super grateful and I’ve committed here. I think my interview went pretty well tho. I connected with one of the interviewers. 

Reach-rejected from Johns Hopkins. I gave it a shot and fell short. I’ll try again for grad school :-)

***Reflection***

 I’ve been thinking a lot about my college results, and while I’m definitely a little disappointed, I can’t be too upset. I’ve had the chance to get to know a lot of the people at my school who got into places like Berkeley and UCLA for Computer Science, and honestly, their stats were just way more impressive than mine. Most of them took 6+ APs and dual enrollment courses during junior year(easly got A's), while I took 5 APs and 1 honors class with no dual enrollment. They took AP Calc BC and AP Physics junior year, but I chose to take them senior year, and I barely managed to scrape by with an B while struggling the entire time.

***Looking for advice***

The hardest part is that I can’t look back and say, “I should’ve worked harder,” because this was me giving it everything I had.I was running on 5 hours of sleep, doing the best I possibly could.  I just have to look at myself and realize I might not be good enough. Seeing how much stronger my classmates’ profiles were makes me wonder if I can really compete in Computer Science or Computer Engineering going forward.

*Now, I’m stuck between two choices:*

* I can keep pushing myself to the limit and stick with Computer Science, knowing it’s going to be just as intense and demanding. Also I would probbaly go to a college like UCR or UCSC which I don't know if I would get as much oppurunites which means I have to grind harder.
* Or, I’m considering going to community college and trying to transfer after a year for a slightly easier major, like Data Science, which might be more manageable.

I’m honestly just not sure what the right move is right now. I’d love to hear any advice or thoughts you guys have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jloycn/cs_computer_engineering_results_for_bay_area/,1743143973,,25,3.8,Asian,,,"* Classes, Extracurricular",Male

Final thoughts:

I feel like my downfall was my UW, lack of awards, and having mid ahh descriptions for my activities. Overall I'm very frustrated with my results with the UCs but oh well, I'll end up where I'm meant to be. Also I'm very surprised by my common app results as a 4.14 isn't really the best (at my school at least) and I didn't put much effort into my common app essay",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jlo8ej/bay_area_loser_gets_disappointing_ahhh_results/,1743140895,,35,3.81,Asian,"4.

2. FRC Award (team based)
3. SciOly Awards - compiled awards from regionals and states.

5. Honor societies - from school

**Letters of Recommendation**

APUSH teacher: 9/10 letter - We had a 3hr interview where she asked me a lot of questions and we just talked about my interests/goals.

Science teacher: 6/10 - We never grew close. School had a lot of turnover w/ math/science teachers as a whole, so he was my only option. He uses a general template for letters.

**Interviews**

Stanford - 7/10 - Overall a good discussion. He got a master's in CS from Stanford and was pretty informative regarding the program there. We talked a lot about robotics (a general theme in every interview) and about my interests.

MIT - 9/10 - Great discussion. She doesn't sign up for a lot of interviews so she was willing to go over the time. Spoke for \~1:30hr. We talked a lot about goals and our shared interest in a wide range of fields. She said I'd succeed anywhere and it would come down to luck in the end, which was sorta reassuring. Something unique that we talked about was the false idea of perfection and living with regrets/stuff.

Duke - 5/10 - Felt rushed. General talk, nothing hyperspecific.

Princeton - 5/10 - Same as Duke.

**Essays**

Probably the weakest part of my application. Overall felt my MIT essays captured my personality best. I'd rate them a 9/10. The rest vary between 4/10 and 8/10. Common app essay was a solid 8/10 (obviously, I am biased).

**Additional Information:**

*Reflection: This process, and all of high school, was a nightmare. I felt pressure throughout HS to be ""the best"" and reach the top of the top. I'll be honest - being rejected by MIT was probably the hardest. A lot of people (incl. alums) told me that MIT would be the ""perfect"" school for me. I spent a lot of time getting to know the traditions and customs of the university, and generated an idealized/romanticized version of it in my head. Getting rejected by a lot of schools sequentially hasn't been fun either. There are a lot of issues in my personal life (largely mental health related) that messed things up (not tryna complain, just being honest). I'm not going to beat myself up over things I can't change. This process is brutal and unforgiving. To those that got in - congrats. To those that got rejected - things will work out. Throughout HS, I mostly pursued my own interests and tried my best to ""apply sideways"" (MIT has an article on this). Applying this way does suck, as it felt way more personal seeing rejections and feeling that I wasn't ""good enough"" for those schools. I do struggle a lot w/ self-esteem and doubt, alongside a lot of internal stuff, and this process was the pinnacle of that. Disappointed overall, but life moves on. I also do not hold high hopes for the remaining schools, to those that see this before the update.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jlny3x/steamrolled/,1743139759,1520,,3.98,Asian,UF,,"MIT, CMU, JHU, Harvard, UPenn, Brown, Princeton, Will update with Stanford, Duke, and GT., Additional Information:**",Male

*I would also like to add that I originally only applied to UT Austin, Texas A&M, UT Dallas, University of Oklahoma, and UC Denver. Once late January rolled around and I got rejected from every single one of them, I started to panic and applied to any college I had any interest in whatsoever, which was dramatic of me but I genuinely had not seen that coming.

Moral of the story: do not be an idiot in high school! I do have many really great options to consider, though, and for that, I am so thankful.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Rec 1: so I actually read this one and I think it was okay. 7/10-ish. I have a very good relationship with this teacher but English isn't her first language so I suppose the letter of rec might not have been worded as well as it could have been, and it wasn't as... enthusiastic as most good ones? she was very specific though and again we have a good relationship so you can tell that we were pretty close

Rec 2: ngl this one might be a 5/10...yikes. might've been my mistake asking this teacher. i think the teacher and i have a solid relationship and he likes me a decent amount but he also doesn't take his job too seriously and i heard from someone else that he has a general template for rec letters that he just copy and pastes and changes some details. i don't think it would be horrendously bad but definitely not anything glowing. 

**Interviews**

Princeton: 7.5/10

MIT: 6/10

Yale: 9.5/10 (bro he literally said ""good luck on your admissions but I don't think you'll need luck""...) 

Harvard: 9/10

Penn: 7/10

**Essays**

ok i'm not going to lie my essays might have been... uh.... not good. i tend to write very verbose and like... mechanically so some of them might have come across as AI-esque. they were overall pretty mid and just about basic stuff like my tennis team experience and teamwork, linguistics and leadership, nothing special. i'd say about 7.5/10 overall. 

personal statement i thought was good, about a 9/10, but i'm not sure. it was about overcoming my attachment issues due to a traumatic (?) childhood and being passed around by relatives when my parents were unable to take care of me. idk maybe trauma dump essays don't work but i thought i took a more... optimistic route?

AP Lit teacher: 8/10, very sweet lady :) can testify to my writing abilities & love for poetry

Mock trial/ethics bowl advisor: 9/10, the teacher I’m closest to by far, he’s endured my presence during long drives to competitions lmao (and me geeking out over philosophy). Genuinely carried with his letter of rec

AP physics teacher: 5/10,  all I did was crash out in his class 😣 (this isn’t even an exaggeration) but he did fill out a rec form that got me into the research program. Likely a generic letter though

Counselor: bad/10 typical template letter

Museum internship director: 7/10, i got to read it and almost cried. It testifies to my personal qualities the most

Swarthmore: hardcore yapped about queer literary theory and gay vampires

I forgot about the rest lol but i do remember writing heavily about my experience with the museum I’m an intern at! 

What I wrote about in my PIQs: 

1. Expressing my creativity through world-building & science communication
2. Elaborated on the summer research program and dealing with imposter syndrome
3. My passion for philosophy & how it relates to fields like economics and environmental policy

**Reflections & Advice**

Keep your grades up, y'all. I had 3 Bs in highschool and skimped out on AP classes to take band instead. Do I regret it? Not really. Were my academics the weakest link of my application? Yup. Still, overall, I'm very grateful for how my admissions cycle turned out :) Entering highschool, I was extremely shy, struggled with crippling body dysmorphia & the lowest self-esteem known to man-kind. But even then life could not grind out the nerdiness & whimsy which drenches my soul (/hj). I kinda just blindly threw myself into anything & everything I thought was interesting or would contribute to any kind of Life Lore (i.e: what would turn out to be the extracurriculars listed on my college apps) and rapidly grew along the way. Do scary things! Go out of your comfort zone! It'll feel like the world is ending, but each time the sun will rise again regardless and you'll realize it was a little less terrifying than the last time.

I guess my point is that you can knock out two birds with one stone. Do things that interest you, and push yourself to become a better person in the process. Things like leadership, public speaking skills, taking initiative, *pursing your passions,* even **bucketlist** items, they're not only 1) loremaxxing and personal development strengtheners but 2) desirable on college applications as well. 

I thought it'd be cool to roleplay as a lawyer in 9th grade. Three years later and I was elected president of mock trial, and won team MVP (slayness). I love nature and nerding out so I seized the opportunity to intern at a natural history museum, e.g, so on and so forth. I know this process is downright soul-sucking at times, but if I could make it (ao3 screentime higher than the amount of sleep I get each night), SO CAN YOU!!!

8 Honors. Took the hardest classes available at my school by far.

Essays: 


LORs: Super strong. I'm super close with my teachers. They say I’m a genius (I’m not even close) They also think I’m a nice person 😃 (I am most of the time don’t worry). They also think I’m one of the best students they ever had in their career and helped me got into MITES 🤷. I’m also just rlly chill with them becuz they’re fun to be around. I’ll miss them 😭. I yap with them everyday and TA for them.😌

Edit: my teacher showed me the letter of recs and it wasn’t as strong as I thought 😭. They only said good things but it was short and a lot of it was restating my resume, so…I wish they talked about how goofy I am in class and stuff. Oh well though lol. Still love them ❤️ 

Interview: MIT: He was really nice and we talked about my day in the life. I guess I didn’t really speak that much about stem. Idk.

Harvard: Interview was okay, but at one point I had to answer why Harvard and I kept going until I said liked the building becuz he kept remaining silent 💀💀💀

Dartmouth: My first rd interview and it was chill

Princeton: I love this interviewer, but don’t remember much of what we talked about.

Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):

Accepted: 
- Harvard!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🙏🙏 (I think I'll most likely committ but the aid package is messed up and I need to contact them)
- Princeton (FULL RIDE PLUS $3650 refund???)🔥🔥🔥🔥🐯🐯🐅🐅
- Brown Presidential Scholars Program (PSP)(Didn't do the Video too :skull:)🔥🙏🙏❤️
- Yale REA🙉🤯 ($84k per year aid/scholarship) (I thought I got no aid at first becuz of that one college financing plan pdf 💀
- Columbia Likely Letter —> ACCEPTED Columbia College Scholars Program FULL RIDE $0 Student and Family Contribution🦁🦁🦁 
- WASHU
- JHU (I applied 3 days after deadline becuz of grace period and wrote about the wrong major in my essays than what I chose on their app 😢)
- The Ohio State University

Waitlist: 
- Cornell Engineering (I applied to this a week after initial deadline)😓
- UPENN Wharton 💔💔💔👿 (also rejected from M&T ofc cuz I’m not built like that)
- Dartmouth 😥😥

Rejected: MIT RA💔💔💔💔 (Everyone else who also did both MITES Semester and MIT WISE got in but me got in so this one hurt especially) But things all worked out!!!

Edit: Stanford: Rejected

Applied to other Ivies to see if I can get more aid (My top school also wasn’t Yale because they didn’t give as much aid and other reasons; I applied REA because their essays were easier to write and now I lowkey fw Yale) 

But yesss, I’m so happy with the results and will most likely commit to Harvard but they haven’t given me my financial aid package yet becuz my thing was incomplete or something 💔💔💔. But yes, I’m super happy!!😊😊🙏🙏

Additional Info from my chance me post that might put more things into context: I don't think my school has sent anyone to an HYPSM ever, most people just apply to local community colleges. The only student that I've heard that got into a T20 was someone who was recruited for Track for Cornell. This might make me stand out in terms of my school but idk how much that'll help. My school doesn't have a lot of resources and student interests in academics so I can't really start a club that much. I got accepted into an internship this summer but had to reject it because of my work at the restaurant and transportation issues. Overall there's not a lot of opportunities at my school and my circumstances also limited the few opportunities I had like sports. I hope my application would be evaluated based on my context and that AOs would see that I really tried to take advantage of anything I could as long as it didn't tax my family's financial situation.🤒🤕

Btw I’m also confident about my app becuz of my school lol. There was one Harvard applicant this year and they got waitlisted. They showed me their app and tbh it wasn’t that good. They didn’t know how to order their activities from most important to least and instead did it in a random order 💀. They also had quite a bit of B’s. They took 20 dual enrollment classes and zero AP classes. They didn’t take calculus and went test optional. They were president of like 3 clubs and was second for congressional art show. They were also very involved in band, played varsity golf for four years, and was section leader for marching band. She did come from a single parent household, but wasn’t FGLI. She applied as a bio premed major. Not saying she’s not smart (she’s definitely more talented than me) but she didn’t care about getting in that much so didn’t try as hard. She mostly applied for fun and still got waitlisted, so I think i have a decent chance tho my thinking might be flawed.

Our school also has no robotic clubs, math teams, 
or competition

I got a letter of rec from my physics and history teachers. I'm certain they are pretty good, but i haven't read them, so I can't give a rating.

I have read the letter of rec my mentor wrote me while researching with em. It was 11/10, I don't think I could write myself a better letter of rec tbh. didn't know they cared for me that much.

**Essays**

I put my heart and soul into these essays, and really didn't feel the need to hide my true identity (Nonbinary ADHD person). It's really hard for me to understand how others can write their supplements a day or two before the deadline of a uni. It took me weeks to feel confident in my essays...

I wrote my personal statement about dumb physics theories I made in elementary school and how seemingly profound ideas could be rendered meaningless without context and purpose, and how that experience inspires me to ground my pursuits in relevance and impact.

Physics / TA teacher: uses AI a lot but IDK

CS Teacher: seemed pretty enthusiastic to write me a letter

Counselor: the one I am most confident about

**Supplementals:** Kind of all over the place, talked a lot about interdisciplinary work / passion for applying CS to meteorology and linguistics, all of them were solid. I think I did a good job at coming across as an interesting person especially at schools that ask weird questions.

**Letters of Recommendation**

My letters of recommendations were probably the single worst thing about my application. If you had to point to any one section that tanked my entire app, it's probably this. I thought I had better recommenders lined up, but 2 of them left and 1 said no. Honestly my fault for not being closer with more of my teachers, but it is what it is.

AP Chem Teacher: 4/10 - Did good in his class, participated fairly, but the teacher is known for writing very terse/average letters of rec. Was not my first choice but I really didn't have anyone else to ask.

AP Physics Teacher: 2/10 - New teacher that I only had senior year. I only knew him for like 3/4 of a semester when he wrote my rec. My absolute last choice to ask.

Regular US History Teacher: 2/10 - I only asked him because of MIT's humanities teacher requirement. I really didn't know him that well, I was at most cordial.

Robotics Coach (Optional Rec): 3/10 - Great relationship with him, knew him for 6 years and he's helped me become the person I am today. But he's not the greatest at writing, and ended up using ChatGPT to write it. He asked me to review it and I made some small edits but I didn't have the heart to change it even more.

**Interviews**

MIT: 4/10 - The actual interview was fine, although I didn't get the chance to talk about myself a whole lot. My blunder came when I forgot to email my interviewer a post-interview recap before his report was due (I had 3 weeks and I still procrastinated lol). I can only assume that I didn't get a great review as a result.

Princeton: 6/10 - This one went a lot better, if shorter. I learned from my mistakes and got a lot about myself in the interview. The interviewer was also very nice and interesting. Nothing to write home about, however.

**Essays**

Although my own opinion may not be of much use, I though my essays were pretty good. I spent a copious amount of time on them, going through dozens of rewrites for each. On my CommonApp alone, I went through 15 full drafts, 18 drafts for the UC PIQ's, and a total of 106 drafts for my supplementals. MIT alone was 31 drafts.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UIUC (EA)
* UW
* SJSU
* UCM
* UCR
* UCSC
* UCSB
* UCI
* UCSD (Most likely the school I'm going to commit too 🔱🔱🔱!!)

*Waitlists:*

*Rejections:*

* UT Austin
* MIT
* USC
* Columbia
* Cornell
* Princeton
* Stanford
* UC Berkeley
* UCLA

**Additional Information:**

Is it a coincidence that I only got into schools that don't ask for recommendations? Probably not (although the CMU waitlist *might* be evidence for the opposite). In the end, my recommendations being as bad as they were was an unfortunate combination of my lack of initiative as a student as well as 2 of my teachers leaving my school district start of senior year.  I don't think any of them straight up sabotaged my recommendation, but they definitely were really bad.

My status as an international applicant also had a major impact. It's completely out of my control, and meant that every single private and out of state school was significantly harder to get into. Regardless, there's no point in pondering what could or could not have been.

I actually ended up feeling a lot less sad about my rejections than I expected, probably because I got into UCSD. I'm really grateful for them accepting me; many of my friends who are honestly a lot more qualified (higher GPA's, better AP scores) didn't get in or get waitlisted.

For the class of 26 and all other future applicants, my advice would be to write and keep writing. You'll go through so many drafts of your essays, but you'll know when it's finished. Don't procrastinate. And finally, don't stress.

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

Paid job as a tutor, I've held this position ever since the summer after my freshman year, I think I have at least 600 hours overall

Started a fundraiser for the teachers at my local elementary school, raised funds and supplies for them so they didn't have to pay out of pocket for supplies, around 40 hours overall

Schoolhouse SAT Tutoring - 40 hours overall, I plan to do more now that college admissions stuff is done

Math Team - I had an informal leadership position, won a few awards for school top scorer and perfect scorer, around 250 hours overall

NHS Treasurer - Around 30-40 hours overall, mostly planned volunteer and service events, I took a large role in the big event that our NHS does every year

Community Magazine Writer - My community has a magazine that they give out so I've written a few articles for them \~20 hours

Air Riflery - \~80 hours - I mostly did it cause I wanted to do a sport that didn't take up too much time. Unfortunately I could only do it for one year cause I needed to grind college apps and whatnot. I enjoyed it a lot but I could NOT stay still.

JV Baseball - \~250 hours, Baseball has always been my passion but unfortunately I was injured when I was young and was really rusty when I came back. Unfortunately I couldn't play jr and sr years because I needed to focus on academics (I probably wouldn't have made it anyways) I still wonder about what would've happened if I was able to play all 4 years

Investing - I legit put this on my app 💀 I spend around 5 hours a week researching investments, looking at financial statements, reading books, and watching videos on investing. I'd like to learn how to trade some day but that's a different story

**Letters of Recommendation**

Math Teacher - 8/10 - I've known her for a while, I did well in her class and she is the leader of the math team. I think she likes me because I'm pretty quiet and all the other top scorers are pretty loud sometimes (and don't always come to practices)

Business Teacher - 6.5/10 - Honestly I wish I got to know her better, I've had her class for all 4 years; I still have a good relationship with her but I could've gotten to know her more

**Interviews**

Stanford - It was decent, we both bonded over being Vietnamese lol

Rice - I thought it was pretty bad, I remember one specific question where I sat there for like 30 seconds to think and then still proceeded to give a bad answer

**Essays**

8.5/10 - I think I did really well on the essay, I wrote about my struggle with Tourettes and what I learned from it

Supplementals were pretty good as well, I tied most of them back to connect back to Hawaii (however I remember I wrote one about being happy that the Yankees made the World Series, which unfortunately didn't age well 💀)

**Additional Information**: Overall, looking at how competitive this year has been, I am so happy to have such a great acceptance from UT Austin. I didn't have internships/ big passion projects, as I didn't realize I wanted to do business until the middle of Junior year 😭.

Everyone told me to apply to a lot of schools, but I didn't shotgun, as I knew in my mind that I had a good shot at UT, and it wasn't worth applying for schools I wouldn't go to (I'm also just lazy lowk).

I want to put this here for anyone who is worried about their gpa or sat score. I did have some circumstances which caused my grades to drop especially in Sophomore year, but I didn’t really explain it in my application. I did show a steady upward trend since then. Moral of the story is, colleges look at everything holistically(especially NYU), your gpa is not everything!!! A good essay and good ecs can definitely make up for a low gpa. The fact that I got accepted into NYU, waitlisted to Northeastern, guaranteed transfer to BU, and a bunch of acceptances just shows it.
I am STILL in absolute shock because I thought I was cooked with my gpa.

**Letters of Recommendation**

CS Teacher: 9.5/10? I was shocked when he sent me the LOR.... it literally said I was his best student he has ever had. 

English teacher: 6/10? I know he thought pretty highly of me because I always did really well on the essays and contributed in ways that I at least thought were insightful to class discussions, but I was certainly not his top student and we didn't have much of a relationship besides coursework. 

Math prof: 4/10. I am not sure what to think but I don't think I really stood out in her class. I did pretty well in the class though.

**Interviews**

MIT: Went really well. We talked for about 30 mins past the time frame given and just chatted about advancements in AI. At the end of the interview, I was told I would be a really good fit for MIT.

Rice: Idk it was really short and felt kinda awkward but my interviewer seemed to think pretty positively about me and I didn't make any major mistakes. 

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Personal statement: I think it was pretty mediocre? I spend a lot of time on it but lowkey I am not a good writer lol. I talked about my love for problem solving, overcoming my egotistical urge to be the one who solves every problem, and how that has made me an effective collaborator. I used ant colony optimization as a metaphor lol. 

MIT: I'm actually really proud of my writing. I felt like I poured my heart and soul into a few of the SAQs, and my parents said that they reflected my personality well. I tried to emphasize collaboration and problem solving in these.

Rice: I am pretty proud of my residential college essay (I talked about bad ideas lol). My why major was okay but pretty basic and I still cringe at my why Rice. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

Iowa state: accepted EA

University of Minnesota: accepted EA

Michigan State: accepted EA

University of Wisconsin-Madison: accepted EA

Rose-Hulman: accepted EA

Northeastern: deferred EA->chose not to be considered for RD (I only applied because no app fee LOL)

MIT: deferred EA->rejected RD

Rice: ACCEPTED!!?!?!! RD

**Concluding thoughts**

I am still high on my Rice acceptance. This does not feel real to me. College apps has been an insane emotional roller-coaster for me, because one one hand I logically thought I had very little chance of getting accepted to Rice or MIT but the emotionally part of my brain couldn't stop daydreaming about getting accepted. MIT rejection hurt, but I after it I made peace with going to my safety. Then I was blown away by Rice acceptance! :)))

The weird thing is I have dreamed about making a post like this sophomore year and thinking of ""insightful"" things to say but honestly none of them sound fitting right now. I guess it just feels weird to actually be in this spot, realizing that anything I saw will sound like someone who has been incredibly fortunate preach from the rooftops. I guess that's my biggest takeaway. The process is pseudo-random. ~~Obviously a meritocratic process wouldn't accept me.~~ I am very lucky but that doesn't give me any sort of authority or mean I am any smart than anyone else. 

I think college apps is a weird sort of game. Part of me almost feels bad for playing. Seeing so many friends that I have immense respect for and were critical to being where I am now not getting into their dream schools makes me question if my acceptance was really a result of somehow ""deserving"" to get in or it I just put more of my effort in this ""game"" instead of genuine progress. So I guess if any of you guys are reading this post: thank you for everything. You are talented and deserve just as much if not more than I. I hope ivy day goes well!

Oh and the title was a challenge between my friends and I that anyone who got into Rice would have to drink a rice smoothie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jkvgo4/nerd_drinks_a_rice_smoothie/,1743048242,1520,34,3.98,White,"The weird thing is I have dreamed about making a post like this sophomore year and thinking of ""insightful"" things to say but honestly none of them sound fitting right now.

- My essays were by far the strongest part of my application. They were mainly revolving around my struggles in high school, and how I had to work so hard to find myself as a person, and how I did so much despite not having any direction, and how I began to turn things around even at my worst (some personal struggles I won't detail). I wrote it kinda bad here, but I definitely made a great narrative.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

calc bc/calc 3 teacher: I can't give a rating because I have never read a letter from my calc teacher but in terms of our relationship I was top of his class for bc and would come in regularly after school to talk more in depth about the topics he taught during class because I was interested in calculus. I also helped tutor for him before tests as well.

ap csp/csa teacher: can't give a rating as well cause I have never read anything by him but this relationship was more casual because we didn't have to learn as much in his classes so sometimes my class would just watch random youtube videos or play videogames. Me and him share similar interests in videogames so we would talk about that. I also still worked hard in his class and also came in sometimes for help or further discussion on some topics.

quality was probably buns, I was so overwhelmed with school and stressed about college because of reading other people's decisions on here that I wasn't even starting my applications until like December 31st so I wrote my common app in a day and did a college a day.

1jks1xn,USACO Platinum gets rejected everywhere.,"Sharing this early slightly ahead of Ivy day because I'm about to break down and don't think I'll be able to do this tomorrow, and I know based on these results I won't get in anywhere tomorrow.

Demographics: Indian Male, very competitive high school (feeder to T20’s)  
GPA: \~3.8 or so, about average at my school.  
SAT: 1560 (780 r[/W](https://www.reddit.com/r/W/), 780 M)  
**CS major**

Coursework: 7 AP’s, Stem ones are CSA and Calculus BC. More were offered at school, just coudn't take them for reasons (self studied some). All 4's on the tests.  
Linear Algebra (college level), Calc 3 (college level), Newtonian Mechanics (college, online), Electricity and Magnetism (college, online), Organic Chemistry (college level), Genetics (college level)   
I got a B+ each in Precalculus and Algebra 2

I have some extenuating circumstances which caused my gpa to be pretty low overall (mostly in 9/10th grade), that I talked a little about in my essay. Basically abusive parents causing me to have to take on more family responsibilities and not be able to commit to school.

Also upward trend? (sort of)  
Freshman - 91  
Soph - 91  
Junior - 94  
Senior 1st sem - 96

EC’s (gonna be very vague):

* Freelance Developer (spent a lot of time on this), $10k made
* Sole founder/developer of a business project combining AI and chemistry, 5k+ users. Mostly a solo research/passion project but also working on the business side as well. (Not a chatgpt wrapper/LLM)
* Develop/release software online, 1.1M+ downloads
* VP of Research Club (kinda big at school)
* Started my own tutoring organization
* Made my own blogging website, 1.2M+ monthly impressions (kind of an inflated number because impressions != clicks, but big number I guess)
* Some other summer programs I attended, nothing like RSI though

Awards: 

* USACO Platinum
* Some other community awards that are pretty good (better than PVSA, but nothing crazy)
* Some awards from summer programs
* AIME qual but I only included for Columbia/MIT because they had a dedicated section

Copy pasted from chanceme but I think this is going to be my last college results/chanceme post. Thank you everyone for the support and advice. The title is kind of clickbait but also a year ago if you told me a USACO Platinum didn't get into any college besides their safeties I would've laughed my ass off at you so that's why I titled it that. People seemed to really like that award on my chanceme posts and I was quite proud of the time and effort I put into competitive coding but I guess it didn't help after all.

I'm not sure if it got devalued due to cheaters or if there was something else wrong with my app but that's the way things went.

Not sure where to go in life now. Will figure it out once I stop crying.

1jjsycx,MIT WISE + MITES —> MIT Reject 🫠,"I guess the MITES + MIT WISE Fly-in pipeline is not real for me🫠. Everyone else who did both MITES Semester and WISE got in so I feel further devastated and inadequate and also kinda left out like why was I not good enough (I kinda have a feeling on why). It is what it is though lol.

Oh yea, this is also just the update of the Skibidi Ohio Sigma Boy college results post. So…there will a lot of repeats

Demographics: Asian American 😭 , Male, First Generation College student and Immigrant, low income student, 34k income for family of 4 😛, Uncompetitive and Underfunded, title 1 funded and eligible high school in suburban/ruralish (it says suburban for NCES once we got our new school building) Ohio with basically no clubs and extracurriculars aside from music and sports. The school is surrounded by cornfields. School average ACT is 17 😣. I got the highest ACT in my school and probably the only 36 in my county but idk. Oh, also might major in Applied Mathematics but not sure, but that's what I applied as.

ACT: 36 Composite 36E 36M 35R 36S ✨👹👹

Unweighted GPA and Rank: current unweighted GPA 4.0UW / 4.726 weighted; 4.76ish weighted by end of Senior Year if I get all A’s

Ranked 1/122 Coursework: 2 AP, school only offers 2 (3 actually but I couldn’t take it because they added it this year and it’s only for 10th grade), 20 dual enrollment in total by senior year (subject to change depending on if I acquire funding for additional dual enrollment classes since I’m past my free credit limit) On my application at the time I only had 18-19 dual enrollment courses but it doesn’t really matter I guess since it’s 2nd semester courses anyway 

8 Honors. Took the hardest classes available at my school by far.

I also got rejected from QBNCM Finalist probably because of assets 😣🙉

I mean I also would’ve started going to the gym earlier if it wasn’t fucking $30 per month and $50 + tax fee just to start but you know it is what it is. Sorry for the rant 💀 ) and U.S. Presidential Scholars Candidate

Essays: 


LORs: Super strong. I'm super close with my teachers. They say I’m a genius (I’m not even close) They also think I’m a nice person 😃 (I am most of the time don’t worry). They also think I’m one of the best students they ever had in their career and helped me got into MITES 🤷. I’m also just rlly chill with them becuz they’re fun to be around. I’ll miss them 😭. I yap with them everyday and TA for them.😌

Edit: my teacher showed me the letter of recs and it wasn’t as strong as I thought 😭. They only said good things but it was short and a lot of it was restating my resume, so…I wish they talked about how goofy I am in class and stuff. Oh well though lol. Still love them ❤️ 

Interview: MIT: He was really nice and we talked about my day in the life. I guess I didn’t really speak that much about stem. Idk.

Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):

Accepted: 
- Yale REA🙉🤯 ($84k per year aid/scholarship) (I thought I got no aid at first becuz of that one college financing plan pdf 💀
- Columbia Likely Letter
- WASHU
- JHU
- The Ohio State University

Rejected: MIT RA

Waiting on other Ivies and Stanford

Applied to other Ivies to see if I can get more aid (My top school also wasn’t Yale because they didn’t give as much aid and other reasons; I applied REA because their essays were easier to write and now I lowkey fw Yale) 

Also if it sounds whiny, sorry. I am privileged to be sad over the rejection but it does make me feel left out from all my MITES friends that got in. 😢🙏I do love Yale though so yay. 😊

Additional Info from my chance me post that might put more things into context: I don't think my school has sent anyone to an HYPSM ever, most people just apply to local community colleges. The only student that I've heard that got into a T20 was someone who was recruited for Track for Cornell. This might make me stand out in terms of my school but idk how much that'll help. My school doesn't have a lot of resources and student interests in academics so I can't really start a club that much. I got accepted into an internship this summer but had to reject it because of my work at the restaurant and transportation issues. Overall there's not a lot of opportunities at my school and my circumstances also limited the few opportunities I had like sports. I hope my application would be evaluated based on my context and that AOs would see that I really tried to take advantage of anything I could as long as it didn't tax my family's financial situation.🤒🤕

Btw I’m also confident about my app becuz of my school lol. There was one Harvard applicant this year and they got waitlisted. They showed me their app and tbh it wasn’t that good. They didn’t know how to order their activities from most important to least and instead did it in a random order 💀. They also had quite a bit of B’s. They took 20 dual enrollment classes and zero AP classes. They didn’t take calculus and went test optional. They were president of like 3 clubs and was second for congressional art show. They were also very involved in band, played varsity golf for four years, and was section leader for marching band. She did come from a single parent household, but wasn’t FGLI. She applied as a bio premed major. Not saying she’s not smart (she’s definitely more talented than me) but she didn’t care about getting in that much so didn’t try as hard. She mostly applied for fun and still got waitlisted, so I think i have a decent chance tho my thinking might be flawed.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor: (6/10) Don't really know my counselor that well but  I feel like I gave her enough information for a decent recommendation.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Probably 6 or 7/10, I should've had more people review them for revisions.

**Decisions (All RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* SJSU

* UCR
* UCSC (Committed)

*Waitlists:*

* UCSB

*Rejections:*

* UCD
* UCLA
* UCSD
* UCI
* USC
* UCB
* Cal Poly SLO

**Additional Information:**

I had a 3.67 UW with only 1 honors class in sophomore year and thought that my upward trend to a 4.0 UW in junior year would be enough to get into at least UC Davis. I knew CS would be difficult for someone without top tier stats but I didn't comprehend that someone with my stats would be basically shut out from most of the UCs for CS. I really hope I get off the waitlist for UCSB.

We'll see about the rest of my decisions, but right now I'm deciding between going to SJSU, UCSC, UCR or CC and transferring. This is an incredibly difficult decision for me as I think I could get into a better UC after CC but I don't know if it's worth missing out on the college experience and being able to focus more on career.

Update: Rejected USC, UCB, Cal Poly SLO. Committed to UCSC.

**Letters of Recommendation**

10th grade English teacher - 8/10. She always thought highly of me and I ended her class average that year with a 92%. My projects were used as references and she was more than willing to write one and had good things to say about other parts of my application.

Club Advisor - 7/10. We’ve known each other for awhile and he really appreciates my leadership, so I think it went well. I would do a lot of the work for officers, I’ve been re-elected and I’ve mentored other club members.

There are other recs but I don’t feel like writing them 😪

**Essays**

Personal essay - 8.5/10. Wrote about how reading an assigned true crime novel for school helped me develop a greater sense of empathy, helped me recover from my diagnosed personality disorder and inpatient stays, and gave me meaning to pursue my career as a forensic/correctional psychologist. A lot of people felt touched by the essay and I spent a massive amount of time on it.

Supplemental essays - 6/10. They were decent but I also didn’t spend too much time on them.

 I ended up committing to Temple University! I think the results were average college turnouts, but I was really proud and surprised by the Waitlists for some reason considering my stats. I do wish I applied to a little more schools though to be honest as I only applied to 8 and got more personal help during the application process but those are my only regrets and I’m really happy with the college I chose to commit too.

AP English teacher - 5/10 (I didn't talk too much in her class, and since she really didn't teach, we barely interacted. And when I asked her for a recommendation, she finished it in 10 minutes, so I'm kind of skeptical.)

Child Development teacher - 6.5/10 (Again, I didn't talk much, but I know she liked me a lot since I was a respectful student, so there's that at least.)

Personal essay - 7/10 (Wrote about saving up for a car via my job at Burger King. I feel like the ending was a little weak, but overall, not too bad of an essay)

**Closing Remarks**

I'm still waiting for a few, but I'm pretty happy where I am now, except that I have to choose where to go to university now (ಠ\_ಠ). Since I have a dual citizenship (US/Canada), it would make a lot of financial sense to go to uni in Canada, but how am I supposed to decide to move to Canada at 18??

I wish I had started earlier on applications and understanding the gravity of literally every decision I made in high school. I should have gotten my shit together two years ago, but here I am. So advice for any incoming seniors (and high schoolers in general), please make sure not to procrastinate on and be serious about something that can determine the course of your lives from here on out.

My extracurriculars were shit, I know, but I did start my application in junior year and did not really look into what it said for the first few of my applications. I know I could have put so many of the things I do outside of school, but I completely fumbled the ball there.

I had some extenuating circumstances regarding my poor grades (death in the immediate family), but I chose not to say anything about it due to my own feelings regarding it and because I addressed it in my common app essay. I don't think it would have changed anything (imo, but it could have). I guess I'm trying to say you don't have to pour your heart out just to get into a university, though as always, it's up to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jix362/a_run_of_the_mill_idiots_results_so_far/,1742838972,,34,3.7,Asian,"School of Visual Arts - 3D Animation and Visual Effects, School of the Art Institute of Chicago - Studio Art - 14k per year, Savannah College of Art and Design - Film - 12k per year, Concordia University (Montreal) - Studio Art, Queen's University (Kingston) - School of Arts and Science, Dickinson College - Archaeology (major) and Art (minor) - 32k per year",,"Rhode Island School of Design - Animation (ED, honestly for the best), Pratt Institute - Film (EA - Def - Rej; did not finish app, expected), Tufts - BA/BS program (Animation/Archaeology) (expected :/ ), Closing Remarks**, I'm still waiting for a few, but I'm pretty happy where I am now, except that I have to choose where to go to university now (ಠ\_ಠ).

**Letters of Recommendation**

**9th Grade Algebra Teacher and Business Partner** (10/10): He adores me and he's mentored me for years. I developed several programs for his company.

**10th Grade Biology Teacher and iGEM organizer** (9/10): She's known me since elementary school, I had major leadership roles in iGEM, volunteered at the lab many times, and was really active in the community.

**iGEM Mentor** (10/10): Mentored the Wiki subteam, she's one of the biggest reasons I ended up doing Computer Science, encouraged me to participate in multiple panels and helped me land my first internship at a college lab. (I also read this letter so I got to see what she said)

**iGEM Mentor** (6/10): Thinks very highly of me and mentored one of the subteams i participated in, but she doesn't know me as well, and can't speak to my accomplishments as much as some of my other recommenders

**Boss from camp job** (8/10): Also thinks highly of me, and admires my work ethic but he hasn't known me for very long.

**Counselor (my mom)** (8/10): My mom, my biggest cheerleader, but also my biggest critic, because she's big on pushing me, plus she knows me as her child, too, so take that as you will. Probably said something about my procrastination.

**Interviews**

**URochester** (8/10): nice interview, nothing too fancy, we talked about my research, his time in college, what it's like at URochester. he was hella late too. but he really liked me and said i'd definitely get a scholarship. we didn't stay in contact, which is really tragic cause he was pretty cool.

**Duke Kunshan** (9/10): pretty short (about 20 minutes, which was the time slot). he asked some questions about my collaboration skills, my research, why i chose iGEM, and told me he loved some things from my personal statement essay.

**Essays**

My personal statement was really strong (according to my English teacher, my professor dad, and some friends). It was about my struggle with math, and how I fell in love with it. Tried to talk about having a growth mindset.

Most of my supplementals were about how my struggle getting diagnosed led me to want to study biotechnology and develop systems to make diagnoses and treatment easier for people with chronic, frequently underdiagnosed conditions.

The other ones were mostly anecdotal based (I'm a really great writer, don't ask why I'm not studying English, my parents already ask me enough) tying the prompt into experiences I had.

**Essays**

Pretty good in my opinion, wrote about how motorcycle gear is not designed for women and makes women less safe and comfortable, also its ugly. I thought I cooked on the Cornell supps but clearly not. Most other schools didn't have supps though, if they did, I wrote about sustainable design.

CS teacher: Thinks I'm an autistic genius. Told me he wrote a brilliant recommendation.

Math teacher: Only taught me last year, but I was the top student in his classes, like the only kid who would always be able to answer a question everyone else was stuck on even if I was absent for a topic (I didn't really pay attention in any class lol). I did love his teaching style, like if I was bad at math it would have helped me a lot with concepts

Counselor: not a great recommendation

**Interviews**
Didn't give any. Some portals had optional interviews or videos but I didn't do them. I'll mention this in decisions.

**Essays**
I applied on deadlines and once or twice a few hours late, so didn't really have much time for supplementals, but I tried to make them the best I could. Common app essay was about why I like math.

Parents weren't allowing me to apply abroad until Jan 10th, so I didn't have a lot of options. They're still not allowing me to go abroad, so I'm go to a local university. I did get 1 or 2 colleges to extend their deadline. Wasn't allowed to ED anywhere other than NYUAD, but by then I didn't have time to write essay and apply and had to do it in RD.

 Would have applied HK or Singapore or considered a gap year but not allowed. I got accepted to University College Dublin in Ireland but I applied late and I couldn't apply for the 100% scholarship.

**Additional Information:**

Kinda cheesy but omfg this was a wild ride and a rollercoaster of emotions. 

i didn't have high hopes considering my grades, my dream school was UCF but getting deferred made me almost cry, then i looked into UF more, visited campus and it became my dream school, then getting deferred from UF made me cry. i was legit checking my UCF application portal every day to see if i got accepted/rejected since january, and i had just about accepted that i would end up at USF until on thursday i got the email i was accepted, so i held out for UF and actually got in!

now, i'm wondering if i had applied to places like Georgia Tech, Purdue, USC, etc. i might have gotten in! regardless tho, i'm happy to be a gator :)

*my takeaway from my experience doing college applications after talking with friends who got rejected (one of whom was mad i got in, even saying i was only accepted to UF because of DEI. they're no longer my friend) is this:* i feel like colleges are definitely more interested in you exploring your passions than taking up activities like leadership positions for the sake of padding up your application. if you're passionate and your activities reflect that, you'll go far",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jez9gk/hispanic_gal_applying_only_instate/,1742397125,1300,30,3.739491244,Hispanic,"\- University of Florida (deferred EA), \- University of Central Florida (deferred EA), \- University of South Florida, \- Florida Atlantic University, \- Florida International University, \- University of Tampa, \- Florida Atlantic University, \- University of North Florida",,\- Type of School,Male

Ok ok so here's the thing y'all: I was pretty much under the GPA requirement for most of the schools I applied to, but I'm seeing actually massive success so far. I think my case really represents how much universities value a decent SAT score and essay.

My grades aren't catastrophic, but, relative to my district, they're pretty rough.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Probably pretty rough lmao, most of my teachers from Freshman and Sophomore year dislike me heavily because I goofed off and performed terribly, so I had to choose another one that didn't love me...

**Essays**

My essay was undeniably incredible. I spent hours upon hours redrafting it until the every component was impeccable. It was not only a gripping story, but it also showcased who I am as a person and also how I have developed through my life, while intertwining two things that are incredibly important to me personally. I would have to say it is a 9.5/10 essay.

Essays:
I applied to a lot of schools rushed and my first essay was pretty ass ngl. The revision was really good to me and I used that to apply to the rest of them. I wrote about my love for space, and how it got me out of my comfort zone and showed me how I could make friends even when extremely introverted, cuz I had none.

Decisions (it's a lot but they were all free bc of some financial circumstances at the time of applying and I like all the scholls so might as well)

Accepted: 
• ASU Honors 
• U of A Honors 
• Rutgers NB
• CU Boulder 
• Denison 
• Stony Brook  
• Pitt
• Penn state (2+2 at behrend)
• MSU
• UDel
• Drexel
• USF (spring term or summer waitlist oh hell nahhhh)

Waitlisted:
• UofSc
• WPI

Deffered:
• Minnesota Twin Cities (I think I messed up the name of a professor on my supp, naming a professor from a different school and aye i applied off an all nighter so I'm not surpirsed lol)

Denied:
• UIUC (this was my dream school lol kinda sucks)
• Clemson
• U Richmond
• CWRU
• OSU 
• Oberlin
• WashU (obv it was gonna happen but wanted to apply bc I loved the school)

Waiting:
• Wesleyan (connected on collegevine, ik it means nothing but let me be delusional thx)
• UNC
• NC State
• UW-Madison
• UMD
• UCF 

Ngl I was so sad when I got rejected from UIUC but I was NOT good enough. Still hurts tho. I think I did pretty good with these stats. Def didn't expect to get into Denison but I'm greatful. I fell off a cliff junior year, like idk what happened. I started skipping school and getting credit withdrawn (had to clutch up attendence to get it back). My 1st semester junior year i got a 2.5 GPA 💀💀💀💀 yeah I know... My mind was going crazy. Good thing I made the absolute craziest academic comback, it was just a little too late for college app season. Anyway my top choices so far are:
1. Rutgers NB: in-state, would cost 32.k/year. 2. Denison: would cost 27.5k for 2025-2026 year w/o books, transportation, etc. they said it would be an extra ~4.5k so basically around the same as rutgers.
3. Penn state 2+2 at behrend: would get in state cost bc of military dependent status.
4. ASU Honors: gave me 17.5k/year, hopefully I can get more if that's possible. Honors costs an extra ~2k/year so basically I got 15.5k/year. I'm gonna call and see if they can match price at diff school. Prob not but worth a shot.

1jcwyzf,Rural Asian bum bags UChicago RD w/o national recognition,"**Demographics**

* Gender: M
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian
* Residence: Rural New York, and then Rural Colorado
* Hooks: Rural, Academic oddity. I spent 9th and 10th grade in a...financially and academically challenged boarding school in rural New York. For reference, when I joined it had a 9th grade class size of a whopping 10 people, no senior class, and offered 0 sports or APs---it was a new school. Onwards was spent in rural Colorado where most everyone stays in-state for college. 
* Fav Color: Purple! 

**Intended Major(s)**: Applied Mathematics, unsure in reality

**Academics**

* GPA/Rank (or percentile): 4.4, Valedictorian 
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 14, took a ton of college courses
* Senior Year Course Load: Linear Algebra (got a B 😭), Calc 3, AP Physics C, AP Lit, AP Gov
* SAT/ACT: 1600 superscore, one taken paper, one taken online.

**Awards:** Very generic stuff. Rural and Small Town Recognition Program, AP Scholar with Distinction, National Honor Society Member.

**Extracurriculars/Activities:** 

* Interned for the local DA office (perks of a small town), 
* Model UN founding member
* Speech and Debate captain 
* Track
* Piano player for local church. 

No awards for any of those. 

**Essays:** 

To make it unbiased, I asked ChatGPT to rate my essays. 

Why UChicago essay: GPT rated 9/10. TBH, a big reason for applying to UChicago is because they actively encourage creativity in their reponses. I essentially personified UChicago, and used that to ask her 'father' for her hand in marriage. Very flowery. I tried my best with the prose. You can DM me if you'd like to read it!

Free choice: I chose the past make your own idiom prompt. GPT rated 9/10. I had a lot of fun with this one. Since the prompt asked for the origin story of the idiom, I decided to make a mock dissertion exploring how I'd invented the idiom, and how the idiom grew and changed over time---but dissertions are long, so I set in the far far future, where the majority of the pages have been moth-eaten. My essay begins with:

""\[In the rubble of Old Chicago, you find a box with 9 unorganized pieces of crumpling paper\]""

For anyone who's reading this, and hoping to apply to UChicago in the future, don't worry, I didn't write 9 pages. Most of those pages were blank, and were kind of ""gag"" pages. I tried to connect my life's failures to the idiom, and how my failing inspired this idiom. Because of that, this essay was much more personal. However, since this was supposed to be a dissertion, it was written in a somewhat analytical tone. I made the fictional author of the dissertion some poor historian in 2203 who is relying on journal entries and blog posts apparently made by me in our time frame. 

Didn't get an interview. 

  
My academic stats for the application were good, but my ECs and awards were probably abysmal compared to other applicants. If I had to guess, my essays were what pushed my application over the mountain of RD applicants. I'm still shook that I managed to get in. I'm not sure why I made this post. Maybe it's to encourage future applicants to give UChicago RD a chance. I don't remember exactly, but after submitting the basic common app (which is free btw if you're applying for financial aid in any way), I had until the 31rst of january to submit my writing supplement. Considering how the latest applications are usually around the 15th, that gives you an extra two weeks to get creative. Personally, I came up with both formats while in the bath trying to destress after all the other applications were due. So! UChicago seems to place huge emphasis on essays! If you're on here, reading this, you're probably super funny, creative, and smart. You don't need to be nationally known or a NY times best seller to write a good UChicago essay. Just channel that energy and spend enough time in thinking it over in the bath (or wherever your happy place is).

**mit** \- 1.5 hours, in person. he was a chill dude, the place i picked was a bit loud but we got fries and it was delicious 👅 interview went pretty good, we talked quite a bit about my extenuating circumstances and he told me on the interview report part there was a place to put ""unique things about the individual"" or smth like that and he asked for permission to write about my extenuating circumstances lmao but yeah he thought i was super resilient and independent etc, and that i would be a perfect fit for mit. 8.5/10

**yale** \- 1 hour, in person. i'm pretty sure i was her first or one of her first interviewees lmao but it went pretty good, she asked only a couple questions though so i wish i had more of a chance to talk about myself. i was definitely surprised though, she never asked why yale, she just kept telling me about specific things at yale that would fit my interests 😭 she was super nice though, and said to go to bulldog days if i have the chance, that she would invite me to alumni events if i ever came back to this state, etc 7/10

**duke** \- 40 min, in person. i'm guessing i had no availability in my area so they had an alumni from nyc reach out to schedule an interview with me. she was super cool, worked in the field i wanted to go into and at one point was the cfo of a MASSIVE bank and we clicked pretty well. we talked a lot about my extenuating circumstances and she was very impressed with my resilience and stuff etc. and made comments about how her sons wouldn't have been able to deal with what i went through 😭😭😭??? she cut the interview off at exactly 40 minutes but said we could've gone on and on 8.5/10

**columbia** \- didn't get interviewed per say, but an AO called my counselor to ask about me (my circumstances/character) :p and my counselor told them i was amazing !!!

**Essays**

idk how to judge my essays but i had pretty unique topics esp for the diversity essays because of my circumstances. i think i'm a pretty decent writer and some of my friends i showed them to think my essays are really good, but they're definitely not like life changing or like written super poetically and gorgeously by any means. i think the main good part about my essays is the content, not necessarily the writing style 😭 i'm more of an academic writer

for the schools i applied economics to, i think had a pretty unique and specific reason for connecting my research topic and cs/ai stuff with economics.

**Additional Information:**

i didn't really write about my extenuating circumstances or some of the more unique points about my identity/life because i felt awkward to until i got rejected from stanford rea, so my EAs and UC applications weren't as good or reflected me as completely as my RDs. some stuff like my national award, deca state win, research symposium acceptance, etc didn't come until after the 11/1 deadline, so i definitely think my commonapp RDs were the best version of my application.

Rice (RD): i just winged it😭😭 it was bad ngl because I was def underprepared for it when it came to a lot of in-depth questions about my fit with Rice. Rice was one of my favorite schools but since the interview date was literally a day before my ED decision I couldn't lock in 😭😭

* 6 DEs
* 5s on Calc AB, Government, APUSH, Psychology, Human Geography, and Seminar.

**Essays/LORs/Other:**  Optionally, guess how strong these are and include any other relevant information or circumstances.

Essays: 
Something unexpected in educational career:
6/10 I talked about self studying my AP's and how that taught me to take advantage of every opportunity

Diverse Background and collaborations: 9/10 I connected my experience with orchestra friends and how they helped me become more comfortable and explorative about my ethnic background (I'm adopted)

Unexpected situation- 8/10 talked about robotics and importance of teamwork

Why MIT/why field of study: 8/10 stressed living in rural community and wanting to better communities like mine thru civil engineering

Just for the pleasure of it: 10/10 talked about cosplay and being all nerdy about dressing up like fun anime characters

LORS (no rankings)
My counselor likes me and he knows me through other ec's so probably decent
Humanities- I've known him for a few years and so he probably stressed how I use my opportunities and that I come from a single mother household
STEM- I've known him for 3 years and we've connected over our love of physics and science. He's really pushed me and so I think he did a pretty good job showing the real me

Interview:
Loved loved LOVED my interviewer!! It was super laid back and we yapped about our cats and crocheting for 1/2 hr before we actually started talking about actual MIT stuff. This is the only college interview I've had so it's hard to judge it against others but I felt like I conveyed the real me very well and showed what I was passionate about from the start. 

**Schools:**  
EA:
Georgia Tech (accepted)

**RD:**
MIT (accepted)

Really I don't know how I got this so I'm just posting this to provide some hope for some applicants that may think they have no chance at all. Sure maybe it's the fact that I come from a rural area but my stats r pretty below what u usually see from an MIT accepted person. I've never done any international competition or won big tech stuff lol. College admission process is definitely something so keep at it!! Just do what you love regardless of where you end up. Personally I'm still deciding between GT and MIT precisely because there are a lot more factors than rank or prestige. I wish everyone luck and thank you!!

1j5heoc,Old person results from the 2000s,"I'm not sure if this is allowed or interesting, but thought it'd be funny to try to remember and give a bit of a fun time capsule take given the current stressors. I applied to college in the mid-2000s and attended a public high school in southern California.

**Demographics**

* Gender: male
* Race/Ethnicity: white
* Residence: CA, USA
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): double legacy at Yale

**Intended Major(s)**: parents were both lawyers (since retired), so the intention was to do pre-law. I was interested in electrical engineering, but didn't have much coursework to back it up. listed major for my applications was either political science or economics. I ended up majoring in mathematics.

**Academics**

* GPA: 3.9 UW
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Hard to remember exactly, but I do remember taking APUSH, French, Calculus AB (??), World History and government classes. I did well on all the tests, didn't bother taking the French one, and took the English test despite not having taken the class.
* Senior Year Course Load: Ethics (?), French ""5"", Anthropology...can't remember what the rest were. I actually didn't take a math course at all senior year. Not ideal.

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT: we were one of the first years to use the test rework with a 2400 point scale. 740 reading, 720 math, 800 writing, with a perfect score on the essay section. I remember gloating about that a lot, and about getting a better overall score than our valedictorian.

**Extracurriculars/Activities:**

* State tennis champions twice, varsity singles junior/senior year, USTA ranked regionally top 10 in my age group for three years
* ""Computing Club"" - mostly digital electronics projects and programming stuff, which me and my best friend actually started before high school. Some cool stuff came out of that club - we made shitty little games, websites, Quake mods, rockets, etc. Held LAN parties. Several parents donated vintage computer gear for us to tear down and poke at, including a Mac 128k, which we managed to restore. One member went on to be a reasonably big player in the video game industry, and one is now an exec at a FAANG company. Neither of those is me.
* I did competitive go-karting for several years.
* I won a few awards for art pieces in local shows and a significant award for an album of travel photography. This one is funny because I am fucking garbage at art.

**Awards/Honors:**

* Honor Roll all four years
* Statewide photography award
* AP Scholar
* Might've been other ones

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** I had a very close relationship with my junior year chemistry teacher of all people, and I'm pretty sure I got an 11/10 LOR from him, like absolutely gushing.

   * Columbia (<-- graduated 2012)
   * UCLA (<-- strongly considered this as I had several friends going, but went with my gut)
   * UC Santa Barbara
   * UC San Diego
   * UC Riverside
   * Boston University
   * ASU
   * Arizona
   * SDSU
   * SFSU
* *Waitlists:*
   * At least one of my rejections was a waitlist, but I can't remember which one - likely Berkeley. I hated Berkeley because I visited as a young kid and got bullied by a student, so I was unmoved.
* *Rejections:*
   * Yale REA (was double legacy here - this was rough)
   * Harvard
   * Stanford
   * UC Berkeley

**Additional Information:**

I don't envy young people these days. My CV would probably land me in Bumfuck State if I was applying this year. There was really not much emphasis on ECs beyond doing things that interested you, at least inasmuch as I was being coached by the relevant adults at the time. Hard to say if I over or under-achieved with these results. The general expectation was that I and all my peers would land at ""good"" UCs - UCSB, UC Davis and even UCSD were pretty accessible back then if you just had your shit together. 

The Yale rejection was an existentially difficult moment for the family - which is stupid, but it was. Getting into Columbia was like being reanimated from the dead -  we didn't overthink it, it was just about going to the ""best"" school I could. That said, there was a big discussion about going to UCLA instead. Two of my best friends were going, it was roughly nearby, would be cheaper, and my dad who was from New York was worried about sending me there. But I did go, and I hated living in NYC but loved the school. My only commentary on this - these blips, inconsistencies and oddities in the admissions process is purely human. Yale didn't ""like"" me, but Columbia ""liked"" me. It's horrendously subjective.

I don't have a trite feel-goodism to end with here. I don't want to insult your efforts or your intelligence by saying ""it doesn't matter where you go to school"" because that isn't true for basically any semantic mode of the question. Lots of people - maybe hiring managers - have fixations on where people went to school. it may not be inconsequential for your career, and it certainly isn't inconsequential for your wellbeing and your development as a person. Getting it ""wrong"" can *suck* for so many reasons, and on what basis do you make all of these decisions? Like a few years of thinking about it and watching toxic youtube videos while your prefrontal cortexes are half developed. Just insane. I'm sorry to you all and best of luck. The most trite thing I will say is that - and it won't feel at all like this now and I won't try to convince you to feel this way before you're ready - you will absolutely grow past defining yourself by this process, and that feels good. So hang in there. This was a fun trip down memory lane, hopefully I haven't doxed myself",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1j5heoc/old_person_results_from_the_2000s/,1741329752,,,3.9,White,"Columbia (<-- graduated 2012), UCLA (<-- strongly considered this as I had several friends going, but went with my gut), UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UC Riverside, Boston University, ASU, Arizona, SDSU, SFSU",,"Yale REA (was double legacy here - this was rough), Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Additional Information:**",Male

Common app

10/10 - I hated it when I wrote it initially but it grew on me. Wrote about my disabled identity and what it meant to grow up crippled. I tried to answer why I choose to keep walking towards my dreams even when it hurts, and I concluded by explaining why some of the things I've been through have taught me to view each day as a gift. It's a pretty common but powerful sentiment within the disabled community.

(AOs contacted me about the essay, though )

For supps:

Tulane - wrote it about how much I love soup, and compared attending Tulane to making soup

Georgetown - wrote biggest involvement one about charity, the special talent one on crochet, and the ""why Georgetown"" on chicken McNuggets + global structural violence

Nova - wrote about being a woman in debate

**ECs (not in order)**
* Loads of music stuff — I’m in my school’s pit band, advanced band classes, won talent shows in the area representing my school, did summer programs in voice and guitar at Belmont, self taught guitar 6+ years, voice 3+ years, classical piano 8+ years, etc… 
* Volunteered multiple summers at summer camp for underserved children in my community, 150+ service hours
* Founded my school gardening club (manage the club, funds, planning for events, etc…) and I’m part of our environmental club 
* Class President for 3 years, student ambassador 5+ years, writing mentor (help students with their writing, counts towards volunteer hours) 2 years, led prom committee my junior year 
* 1 of 3 to graduate with distinction 

**Recommendations** 
* APES teacher + advisor (9/10) 
* Spanish teacher who has taught me since kindergarten (8/10)
* Principal + advisor (10/10)
* piano + school music teacher (9/10)

**Essays** 
I would say my essays are pretty strong. I know I am a strong writer and both of the gold keys I won for Scholastic were in the memoir category which is quite literally the style of many college essays. 

So here’s my dilemma: I applied to be a genetics major or whatever is equivalent at each school. If there was not a genetics option I applied for environmental science. At UNC I would plan to double major in Biology (pre-med so I could do genetics in grad school) and environmental science (they take every AP credit I have plus some DE, so I’d be going in halfway through my sophomore year). This way I could work towards studying how they overlap. I hope to go into some sort of genetic research, public health, etc… However, I worry about if I get into one of my schools up north if there would be better opportunities compared to UNC. Then again I also worry if I’d even be happy in a cutthroat environment such as at a Harvard or Yale. What do you guys think? Is there even a chance I’d get into those other colleges I applied to?

No clue: I sent packets with diff interactions/memories to recommenders. Never got a chance to read them so I don't want to guesstimate. However, will note here that I got two humanities letters.

**Interviews**

Georgetown: rlly rlly great, easily my best, felt like a conversation and was really shocked at the end when my interviewer said that he went through all his required questions

Northwestern #1 (technically a non-evaluative alumni convo but one of my interviewers had a notepad out, so guessing that its at least a lil evaluative): pretty good, felt very informal again, most of it centered around life in Texas (interviewer also from area), and upcoming transition to NU

Northwestern #2 (same format as above): meh, not particularly good or bad, just very standard 

**Essays**

I spent tons of time on essays and showing a good fit to all my majors.

Personal Statement: About a childhood event (nothing super duper serious), how I revisited it in high school, and how I grew to approach it with a new mindset, and then how I now apply that mindset to diff elements of my life/career

If y'all have any questions abt what I wrote for specific supplementals for schools I listed or wanna read any essays just DM me. I also have dipped my toes a bit into college essay advising so would love to work with anyone on their apps.

**Essays**

Common App Essay/UW essay: The main idea of my essay revolved around self-growth and finding myself after struggling with depression and being over dependent on others throughout my life. It was pretty corny but I spent like 4 months on it. My friends and teachers who reviewed it all said it was good so yea :). (7/10)

UW Diversity Essay: Wrote mostly about my religion and my struggles to find myself and my identity. (5/10) I spent less time on this essay and had two ways to go about it and ended up choosing a safer and less emotional option. 

UMN Essay: 5/10 I could barely remember it and I didn't spend almost any time outside of 3 drafts writing it. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

My other options would be UMN TC and SU. Tbh NYU was like a fever dream I've wanted to go but thought I'd never have a chance but I applied b/c fuck it we ball.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Science professor (including Chemistry Olympiads coach): Formerly awesome relationship, now pretty good still. LOR was... Ok. He complimented me but with no specificity in it. Probly neither helped nor hindered 6/10.

Foreign Language teacher (English): Absolutely amazing teacher and wonderful LOR. I almost teared up when I read it. She said not only wonderful things about me but made it feel personal and genuine. 10/10

Counselor: Good LOR and mentioned something which put me in an extremely good light which I'd absolutely forgotten. 9/10

Additional recommendation (Science mentor): Pretty good. Said very nice things about me but he clearly hadn't written a LOR before (expectable coming from Argentina). 7.5/10

**Essays**

**Personal Statement**: I believe it's extremely good. It shows a deep growth period a couple of years ago, my love for life and learning and desire to be immortal. I was putting all my hopes into this being what set me apart from others.

**Why UChicago**: I started it off making it very generic. I mentioned I wanted to help Human progress and I wanted an academically rigorous education and research experience to help me. THEN, I acknowledged how generic that was, and mentioned the things I liked specifically about UChicago, namely its focus on curiosity, the Core, and the people.

**Free Essay**: Has Humanity won?: A metaphor of Humanity as a videogame build which tried to show how organized religion historically hampered Human Progress and my optimism of how far Humanity has to go yet.

The UChicago essays were very rushed, but I believe my focus on technological optimism probably significantly helped me.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Both teacher recommenders let me read their recommendations

My Social Studies Teacher #1, My favorite teacher ever frfr. His letter was very formal and basically said how I'm a hard worker, I challenge myself, and the colleges would be lucky to have me <3

Math Teacher #2, I struggle in math but he's a real one. He said very positive things about me and explained most of my struggle in his class is because I have a chronic illness and have missed class-time but that I'm doing well for that situation.

Counselor #3, she didn't let me read it, but I never asked.  She's my Quizbowl coach and basically my bestie so I have all faith and trust in her that she wrote a good letter.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I wrote about my disability and overcoming shame. I had basically anyone who had eyes read it before submitting, and got very positive reviews. I connected having a visual disability to my style choices and tried to be making metaphors and stuff. I was told that I handled that well and managed to make it not read like a sob story while still being touching.

I kept this post vague to maintain my privacy. If you figure out who I am or know me from somewhere else, please don’t say anything.

Demographics: White/male/upper class (150-250k income bracket)/semi-competitive suburban public school (about 350 in my graduating class)

Hooks: none

Intended major: Math

**Academics:**

4.0 UW/4.63 W (no class rank)

\# of AP/dual enrollment: 25+, most were in math (I got to very high level (4000/graduate) math). Outside of math I did things like organic chem, statistical mechanics (physics), and a few high-level stat courses.

Senior year course load: 3 AP’s, 3 grad level math/stat courses, PE

**Standardized Tests:**

ACT: 35; first try/not superscored, sent everywhere

AP Scores: 8 5’s, 4 4’s (5’s on all STEM), reported all scores

**EC’s:**

1. Participated in one of the following summer programs: Clark, SSP, Simons, PROMYS, Ross
2. Olympiad prep/self-studying STEM stuff: I spent a lot of time studying things just because I enjoyed them. I was the first person from my school district to get a national-level award in any olympiad. Definitely the most rewarding thing I did in high school and helped me build a strong knowledge base, which is probably the most distinctive part of my application.
3. Quiz Bowl: Captain/leading scorer of my school’s quizbowl team. We were nationally competitive (top 50-100 ish in the country) and had some solid finishes at national championships. We also won states my freshman year.
4. Did math circle/studied math: Learned stuff like abstract algebra, topology, real/complex analysis, etc. lots of proof-based stuff that I didn’t already take at a college or wanted to learn in greater detail. I did a lot of this through a well-regarded math circle
5. Gym/Powerlifting/Fitness: My gym progress probably took more time than everything else I did in high school. I have the second highest bench press in my school's history (310 pounds). I'll get the highest by the end of the year trust. I went from 6’0/155 to 6’3/205 in 2 years.
6. MMA: I train Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I’m a blue belt in BJJ
7. Science bowl
8. Lifeguarded at local pool

Other 2 are filler activities that didn’t really do much for my app and I’m omitting them for privacy (because they’re somewhat unique).

**Awards (vague for privacy):**

1. High-Level Olympiad Award (one of USA(J)MO qualifier, USAPHO Gold, USNCO/USABO t50)
2. Other Olympiad Award (one of USAPHO HM, USNCO t150, USABO t125, USACO Gold)
3. National-Level award in one of the EC’s I listed above.
4. National Merit Finalist
5. National Latin Exam Gold Medalist

**LORs:**

Physics Teacher: 11/10. My counselor said that it was the best she’d seen. Teacher apparently said I was his best student in 20+ years. I went to a few of his tutorials in freshman year to self study calc BC and took AP Phys C with him sophomore year.

AP Lang Teacher: 7-8/10. She’s smart, a good writer, and has known me since age 5 (she’s also my friend’s mom lmao). I’m an above average (but not stellar) English student, so she didn’t have as much to go off of. Definitely a solid LOR, but nothing like what my physics teacher wrote.

Counselor Rec 8-9/10: She def likes me a lot and knows me very well. As far as counselor LOR’s go, this one was probably pretty good. Well above average fs (especially when you consider counselors have to write for 100+ students and they barely know most of them).

**Essays:**

I spent a lot of time writing my essays and had a lot of people (teachers, my school counselor, friends at elite unis, parents) look over my essays. They were pretty well-received.

CommonApp: 8/10. I don’t have any crazy life stories, but I talked a lot about one of the ECs I listed above. It’s not in that upper echelon of essays that can get someone with <1400 SAT and mid ECs into HYPSM, but it was noticeably above average.

Supps: 8/10: Some were probably close to a 9 and others were in the 6/7 range. Overall, they were strong essays.

**Interviews so far:**

I'm not convinced that these are that important (only edge cases really matter). They're pretty much just to make sure you're not an asshole.

Harvard: 8/10. Connected pretty well with my interviewer and we had a lot to talk about because his kids went to my high school. Was irl and lasted about 1.5 hrs.

MIT: 7/10. Was pretty short but she told me it had to be under 40 minutes before it even started. I answered all the questions without stumbling and communicated everything I wanted to about myself. She said she was rooting for me.

Yale Senior Interview: 5.5/10. Stumbled a bit at the beginning because I didn't spend enough time workshopping answers to common questions. I think I came across pretty well though.

**Decisions:**

U of Oklahoma (Rolling): Accepted with lots of money for NMF and a few other random scholarships

Harvard (REA): Deferred. Terrible decision in retrospect bc Harvard REA does nothing for unhooked/non-athlete/non-legacy applicants, especially if they are academics-oriented.

Georgia Tech (EA2, OOS): Accepted + 20k/year (Dean’s Scholarship)

**Withdrawn:**

UGA

May decide to withdraw a few more schools (UVA and UNC maybe) but I'll prolly just wait for everything to come back

**Waiting on:**

UF (OOS). I think I technically get in state because I have grandparents who live there. Not sure how this works rlly.

UVA (OOS)

UNC (OOS)

Vanderbilt

Duke

Northwestern

UChicago

Brown

Cornell

Yale

Princeton

**Essays**

Essays, IMO hard carried me, For my PS I wrote about how breaking 5 minutes in the 500 freestyle led me into a lifestyle of triathlon and other endurance events. Spent every waking moment meeting with English teachers and others and got my essay polished like there was no tomorrow. Same with my other essays, talking about how running in Detroit got to live with different perspectives and how life isn't fair.

**Intended Major(s):** Political Science, Sociology, International Affairs, English, Spanish, etc. (humanities/social sciences)

**Standardized Testing:**
*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

Test optional because….. (However, I did submit my test scores to Questbridge, so the schools I applied to may have seen them. They weren’t bad, but I just felt like they weren’t the greatest. For reference, my school's average SAT score is around an 800 and I got well above that.)

**Extracurricular/Activities**
*List all extracurricular activities involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

(QuestBridge only allows you to input 5, but I talked about all of my extracurriculars, so I’ll list them as well.)

The 5 I input into the Questbridge application:

1. State-wide student equity advisory board
2. American Cancer Society Legislative Ambassador
3. Creative Leadership Program for a mural project in my state (I’ve done multiple murals and other events/art projects with them)

Questbridge Application Designated Spot Awards/Honors:
1. Bank of America Student Leader
2. National African American Recognition Program Awardee

10. Certificate of academic excellence in mathematics (I had a 107% in honors algebra 1… lol)

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. School Counselor - I never read it, but I believe that it was probably a 7-8.5/10 because I talked to her often and I had just moved schools and adjusted to the transfer pretty well.
2. Former Social Studies Teacher - He sent it to me when he finished writing it. 9/10 I loved his classes and got 100s for both quarters and on the finals for each class. Also, this person has connections to the government, so me wanting to do political science came in handy.
3. Former Math Teacher - I never saw it, but I think it was probably okay 8/10. I had him for three years and got really good grades in all of the classes; however, we had a lot of ups and downs soooooo….

**Essays**

In my truly unbiased opinion, I think my essays were good and truthful. I spent a lot of time crafting them to perfection. I think my main essay for QB was the best of all.

**Decisions**

Questbridge Rankings:

1. Columbia University (Rejected/Deferred)
2. University of Pennsylvania (Rejected/Deferred)
3. Duke University (Rejected/Deferred)
4. Barnard College (Rejected/Deferred) (Out of all my ranked schools, I thought that if I matched, it would be Barnard.) 
5. Washington University in St. Louis (MATCHEDDD)
6. Wellesley College (?)
7. Swarthmore College (?)
8. Bowdoin College (?, but I think I got in because I got an email from Questbride before the match saying that Bowdoin was considering me for the match, but they needed something else. They usually just reach out on their own, not through QB.)
9. Amherst College (?)
10. Smith College (?)
11. Williams College (?)
12. Middlebury College (?)
13. Vassar College (?)
14. Boston College (?)

**Additional Information**

I’m still shocked that I got into a QB school, let alone a school I really like. However, I regret not applying to more selective schools, like the ivies because I think I could’ve had a decent chance. Brown University was my dream school and I never applied because I thought my SAT score was too low. 🙁 If I could go back, I would’ve added Princeton and Brown to the list or I would’ve not done Questbridge all together and apply to Harvard REA (lol).

**Letters of Recommendation**

4 LOR's: 

\- AP Econ from junior year, he liked me a lot so I think it's like a 7 or 8 out 10. He writes a lot of LOR's, so I think it's pretty good but not unique.

\- AP Lang from this year, we have a really great relationship and he doesn't write LOR's usually so 10/10.

\- CTO of Y-Combinator backed startup, amazing letter, read it and was probably an 11/10.

\- Director of OHSU, she's known me since freshman year and helped me get an internship in a lab last summer, so I think it's probably a 9/10.



**Essays**

I think my essays honestly were amazing. I don't want to sound conceited but I put a lot of time into all of them and they were all extremely personal. My PS was about eating Lucky Charms cereal in the middle of the night and reflecting on the ups and downs of my life and how I envision the rest of my life to pan out based on past experiences.

I was told a week-and-a-half ago that I was chosen as a 2025 President Scholar Candidate despite my SAT score not being high-enough (and despite some other people in my grade having a higher ACT equivalent). I know it's stupid to add this as an honor, but I feel like I could've added this to my application since it's very unusual for people with ""low"" (as per the standards of the program) SAT scores to get chosen for the award.  Maybe it could've brought out the other aspects of my application that I didn't get into. I could've also talked about my 2nd place at a tennis tournament or maybe mentioned the various placements that I got in sports such as Volleyball and Football (soccer).

1. Received 2 Gold Keys in Scholastic (one in critical writing on a philosophy essay about morality, one in design) and also an honorable mention in photography

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. From my design internship, she is AMAZING I actually love her I read my letter and she made me seem like some amazing person lol, 10/10

2. AP Macro teacher, 7.5/10. I think he likes me since I'm involved in his class and he's the teacher leader of DECA (which I'm involved in)

3. AP Calc AB, 6/10. It's probably pretty meh, like I think she likes me but doesn't love me. I was a pretty average student in her class but we were friendly.

4. School counselor, 8/10. I think she really likes me lol, like she always went out of her way to help me out

5. Art teacher, 6.5/10. I mean we were friendly, but I'm not sure how good the letter was. My school counselor read it though and apparently the letter was good and it talked about my personality, my impact on the community, my art skills, etc., but again I can't guarantee how good the letter is. 



**Interviews**

Duke: 6/10. Very meh overall, I couldn't really connect to my interviewer but I made her laugh a few times despite how professional and stoic she was being. It lasted exactly 30 minutes on the dot. I don't think I made a huge impression, but I don't think I made a bad one either. She said I had a contagious sense of energy and enthusiasm, which my mom says is the nice way of saying ""you're boring"" and maybe she's right x\_x

Rice: 7/10. This interviewer was also really professional and it lasted exactly 30 minutes, but I feel like she was a lot more warm and friendly. I think she sounded impressed from my ECs but I'm worried I sounded too robotic when talking about them x\_x



**Essays**

All my EA essays kinda sucked but RD was a lot better but more lacking in personality imo. In general I would rate my EA essays a 6/10 and RD a 6.75/10, so yeah not much confidence in my essays x\_x

  
**Other**

I submitted an art portfolio to every single college, even ones that said they wouldn't accept it lol, and a few colleges that *claimed* they wouldn't accept it still ended up adding it to my file sooooo hopefully that helps. I'm not the best artist or designer but I think it won't have a negative impact at the very least. 

I also completely redid my entire Common App over winter break lol, like new personal statement, new EC descriptions, new additional information, new everything. I think it's greatly improved, but I'm worried it makes me sound too boring x\_x

Essays: 
Personal: wrote about sourdough bread almost killing me. I got appendicitis 😭🙏🏾 crazy enough, I was in Houston when it happened and was taken care of in the hospital down the street from rice. I don’t think I mentioned that though. I talked about how healthcare was more than treatment and included making people actually feel safe and blah blah blah. Idk about it 7/10

Why major?: Wrote about my grandma having Alzheimer’s and facing mistreatment at the nursing home. Went on to talk about wanting to contribute to healthcare equity for non-autonomous patients (older or disabled patients) 7/10? It’s hard cause the word limit is so small.

Why rice?: write about ACEing Autism cause I played tennis and TA’ed for disabled kids. Also mentioned Alzheimer’s buddies for obvious reasons 😪 and the Baylor patient discharge cause that would literally be so fun. Also mentioned the band. I think this was a 8/10 🤷🏽‍♀️ 

Residential college essay: wrote about me being a queer Christian and my experiences with that. Said I wanted to create a space for people who might be battling their faith with identity and tried to tie that to the college system and how it welcomes diversity and inclusivity. Idk how to explain that but I felt like I wrote it well 😭 9/10

LOR: I have truly no clue. It’s my ap lang teacher and my math teacher that I’ve had for 2 years. My counselor is new 💔 

Other: I talked about how my school lost a lot of opportunities after Covid. Bunch of clubs shut down and Covid just got lifted when we started school so my area didn’t have many things I could get involved it. Also a lot of classes weren’t available anymore like physics and the pharmacy tech program I mentioned before. 😞

counselor: prob 10/10, my counselor is really good at their job and knows me very well both in terms of cool stuff that I do+my general vibe

english teacher: 9/10, has taught me for 3 years and seen me grow as a person, I'm proud of the work I do in their class

history teacher: 9/10, me and my history teacher really connected on the level of being nerds about 20th century countercultural art/theory stuff

**Essays**

my personal statement was about learning to appreciate perspectives that I reflexively opposed. I  talked specifically about art as an anchoring example of this

for my columbia supps:

\-why major was about how ordinary people are at the center of politics

\-list of texts was a mix of books, essays, and museums

\-obstacles was about starting my hs speech team from scratch

\-background was prob my weakest one, it was about going to a school with lots of different nationalities and how that enriched my experience. I did mention I was lgbt in this one though

\-why us started by referencing a specific (deceased) columbia prof i really admire, then just talked about the core and the city

in general I think my essays were very strong. my counselor said i was a good writer. i do a lot of writing and reading in my free time so that definitely helped me. reading the essays you could probably tell i was speaking very authentically. basically my goal with columbia specifically was to show i was a very intellectually curious person bc that seems to be what they value.

Super stoked on my results, really think my huge upward trend of GPA since junior year helped a lot (4.0 UW every semester since the start of junior year). Pretty amazed I got directly admitted into Boulder for engineering, it’s been a top school of mine since I was younger and I really am considering committing. Having been pretty worried about college for a while this made me feel happy.

PS Essay is about my reflection on how my atheist status and cultural tradition blends with the religious atmosphere in my high school. Kind of a special one( run it through ChatGPT and it gave it a 9.1/10 lmao).

LOR: Stats/Engineering/robotics teacher, 10/10, he's my absolute favorite teacher and he loves me as well. He introduced me to do research and have been talking a lot with me about colleges/research/engineering. His son just graduated from my high school and got in Cornell and he's willing to do anything to help me get into decent universities and he told me (this sounds weird but it's true) that he wrote a really good rec letter for me.

My mentor at local university: he's really prestigious in ECE stuff. I think he liked me when I was doing research with his students at the lab (or hopefully). 8/10

Calculus teacher: 8/10 She loves me and can talk about my math competitions and stuff.

English teacher: she's impressed by my reading and writing skills as a non-naive speaker, we didn't have a lot of conversations but the rec letter is not going to be bad, 7.5/10

Overall Comments:

I was really disappointed with my results, especially Purdue because I thought I had a chance(I had no chance). I was getting so many deferrals, and my confidence hit an all-time low. I really liked UMich's engineering program, so I WISH that I get an acceptance late March(I know I'm getting rejected) along with USC. I regret not trying harder to get a higher SAT score and my only ways of getting into a ""prestigious school"" is by transferring or applying as a graduate student now, but I'm kinda accepting the fact that prestige is not the only important factor in life, and I'm kinda liking Texas A&M and NC State :) Will update when I get my other results back! gl to all",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1ifxdxe/63_korean_boy_with_very_boring_ecs_gets_deferred/,1738503479,,35,3.91,Asian,"\-NC State:(Engineering OOS, waiting for scholarships), \-Baylor:($130k scholarship+Pell Grant), \-University of Minnesota Twin Cities:(Waiting for scholarship), \-University at Buffalo:($12k per year), \-RPI:($35k scholarship), \-Texas A&M(Engineering, waiting for scholarship), \-Pepperdine, Deferrals:, \-University of Michigan Ann Arbor, \-University of Southern California, \-Northeastern University, \-Macalester College, \-Case Western Reserve University",,"\-Cornell( I only ED'd because I had legacy LOL), \-University of Florida, \-Purdue University, \-University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, \-University of Virginia, \-Georgia Institute of Technology, Waiting:, \-Virginia Tech, \-Lehigh University, \-University of Rochester, Overall Comments:",Male

LORs/Interviews: (briefly reflect/rate)

Common App: Wrote about starting my woodworking company. Went into details about the 60-80 hour weeks I would work over the summer. Talked about how I received a request for a custom project for a Gold Star family, and how it led to me finding fulfillment through commemoration pieces.

LORs

1.) 9th grade economics teacher. Did phenominal in his class, got me really into humanities. Sponsored my FBLA chapter. We were quite close. Did not see letter

2.) APCS teacher. Was also quite close to her outside of class. However, I think that this letter was strong because I came into her class with barely any computer science experience and came out a much stronger student and she said that she would be able to highlight my personal growth in her letter.

Additional Information:

(Not mentioned in my app) My family moved to an incredibly competitive school district when I was young because they were under the impression that throwing me into a school that was successful would instantly make me successful. I was surrounded by wildly successful peers that were able to seemingly effortlessly get perfect grades and win awards in every competition they competed in. I love my parents, but they were not able to effectively guide me as to what a successful high school student looks like. I had no idea what an Olympiad was until earlier this year. I was the one who figured out most of what I had to do in order to remain relatively competitive for admissions (SAT, AP tests, dual enrollment, some debate). I never was able to compete in Speech & Debate, go to national level MUN conferences, attend the FBLA/DECA trips because I simply did not have the money or the parental support like a lot of my peers did. I had to work and make money because I knew it was the only way I would ever be able to afford to go to college. That is why so many of my extracurriculars are work related. I'm proud of what I accomplished, but I know I could have done so, so much more if money was not an issue.

Closing notes: >!I am incredibly lucky to have such a strong state school for what I wanted to do. I would have never expected to end up there, but it made the most sense. I've gotten really excited because I have seen that the student life is fantastic, and as an extrovert, it seems like the place to be. I absolutely know I could have done better throughout high school, but with budget limitations, I think I did about as good as I could've. I withdrew Case after being accepted to Penn State because Penn State is ranked significantly higher for undergrad engineering and I did not like the student life at Case at all. I also withdrew Purdue because it was probably going to be too much money. I was really hoping for Georgia Tech because it was one of the cheaper options on my list, they had the exact research program I wanted to get into, and I want to ultimately end up in Atlanta. Loved student life at Rice whenever I toured and I would go for basically free but I knew going in it was going to be a hard reach.

1. Personal Expenses: When I arrived in America without my parents in 2021, I had almost zero funds with me, so I had to work to pay for my expenses. I worked about \~30 hours a week during my sophomore and junior years (some illegally, lol). Thankfully, my parents are here now, so I can fully focus on academics. This was by far the most important EC on my list.
2. MITES Semester: I attended MITES Semester this summer of 2024. Really enjoyed it and got some rec letter.
3. I interned at *Expedia*, *Spectrum* in a technical role so I them seperately along with my day job.
4. *Photography*: put that there.

The rest are somewhat personal so I would skip it here. They are meaningful to me but according to A2C and r\\collegeresults they aren't anything special.

**Awards/Honors**

I will keep posting my updates about my RD schools as I get them and also I am not too excited right now about my colleges so I will also update some descriptions. I had a 3.99 after sophomore year and as I progressed towards junior year, I realized that there are so many things to do in life rather than just trying to get the best possible grades.

Congrats to everyone of the class of 2025!

Looking back on it, I was worried that applications were getting so competitive that I decided not to apply to any major reaches. Although I most likely would've been rejected, I'm surprised I made almost all of the schools I applied to. I wish I did aim a bit higher, but it is what it is, and I'm happy with my results.

The college application process was just as bad as I heard as a junior - 6 months of writing essays, revising essays, rewriting essays, and numerous calls with my counselor. I was planning on shotgunning to 30 schools but senioritis got the best of me 😭🙏

To everyone contemplating their lives as they're about to start the process for themselves, try not to be lazy like me and get your stuff done so that you send in more applications to get more acceptances.

It was incredibly poetic and made this girl in my class cry when she read it. My APES teacher told me I should submit the first two paragraphs to a competition.

**Additional Information:**

I was recruited to play baseball at Caltech. went on official visit and everything and coach told me he gets ""7-8 in/10 every year"" and I ""check all the boxes with admissions"" so I should be good. turns out I got rejected. i heard the admissions committee passed some rule saying that coaches have less say in admissions bc apparently they didn't know before. idk its stupid and that might've killed my chances. rip.

it's also worth noting for all you potential athletes that recruiting is weird and one small mistake can end your chances, as seen with the tragic tale of caltech. aside from that, though, i was seriously getting looks and talking to both yale and columbia (yale almost had me do a preread at one point) before I had a terrible summer season (fastball velocity was down) and both backed off. I was also talking to MIT but their coach realized my GPA was too low and he told me they couldn't get me in even with support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1iexf77/rural_town_recruited_athlete_asian_kid_bags_early/,1738380706,1500,,3.861331961,East Asian,"UIUC Physics (Grainger, fat W), Purdue Physics, Penn State Physics, Arizona Physics + 64k scholarship, CU Boulder Physics + Honors College (lol I didn't even apply for it they just let me in)+ 25k scholarship, Wisconsin Nuclear Engineering (insane W, #1 plasma physics program in the us), NC State Nuclear Engineering, Deferrals:*, UMiami (might be a yield protection, lowkey didn't talk abt the school at all in my essay and their physics program is mid af), USC Physics (rip I wanted to get in), UMich Physics (rip I also wanted to get in)",,"UNC Chapel Hill Physics (no one from my school has ever gotten in), Caltech Environmental Science & Engineering + Physics Track (bruh.), Waiting For:*, Vanderbilt EDII, UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB UCD, UCI RD, Additional Information:**",Male

**Letters of Recommendation**

Haven't read any of them but...

1. Math teacher of two years: I did very well in both her classes, always participated in class when no one else would and got my work done. Wouldn't say that our relationship was really personal but she does give me praise when talking with other students/faculty.
2. Drama teacher/director: knew her for two years and she's gotten to know me personally. She emphasized my leadership capabilities within the club and my time management
3. Costumes Chief: knew her for many years and we've gotten to know each other. Talked about my involvement with the kids during summer camp and creating costumes for shows

**Essays**

I think that my personal statement is very solid. Talked about how I protected myself with a sweater and I grew as a person and no longer needed it. Related that story back to how I wanted to work with children and wanted them to not feel the need to shield themselves with a ""sweater"" as well.

I also did write an additional information section but I think that it's a very weak. It expanded upon my involvement in the drama program. I tweaked it very late so only schools like Penn and NYU saw the updated version.

I think that my supplements for schools are very well written.

**Additional Information:**

So I was matched through QuestBridge with 90 others who got into Brown (about 2.5k were matched in total and more are waiting for RD. Around 26k applied this year I think). QB is an INSANELY SELECTIVE PROGRAM!!! I understand the bias towards QB kids because they ""get into college easier."" But quite literally there is a lower chance to match than to get accepted through Common App. It's just better suited for FGLI kids. As you can see, my profile isn't that great, especially in the ECs section, so I never thought I would get finalist let alone match TO MY DREAM SCHOOL! Anyways make sure to shoot your shot. If you're a FGLI remember that context matters and maybe apply to QB next year!

**Essays/LORs**

Won't give much details about my essays but It was decent I would say. Common app essay was about a difficulty I had with my 10th grade Math teacher and how I overcame it and learnt important learnings from that experience. I focused on what I did to overcome it rather than talking about how it affected me too much.

LORs : Got 4. One from Counselor (pretty good), one from math teacher (decent), one from computers teacher (pretty good) and one from my internship employer (the first one). The internship LOR was really good since he liked me a lot.

Honestly, I feel like I won't get a decent college at this rate. I really thought that I could get into purdue or uw madison as my target schools, but I guess I was wrong. If I couldn't even get into those colleges I feel like I have little to no chance of getting into whatever colleges I am waiting for now. I know I don't have the best application but I thought it was decent, now I'm starting to think I shud have done better at school and  tried to get more awards and ECs.

**Academics**

**Context:** Where I'm from we have high school from Grade 7-11 and then students can apply to any HS of their choice to complete the 6th form program (Grade 12 and 13) and I'm doing 6th form at \*a school that only calculates my gpa since attending there (so from Grade 12) without recalculating my GPA from my previous school (from Grade 10 - up is how I believe GPAs are calculated). I also believe I did much better academically at my previous school than my school now (I had a lot of As and a few Bs in like English Lit and Add Math) and that could be due to me taking more rigorous courses obvi and also just me adjusting to a totally different academic curriculum in a sort period of time.

And Ik some of you are probably thinking why I even applied to some of these schools but all my life I really wasn't a bad student and I definelty went above and beyond in my academics especially coming from previous high school where the academic competition was most definelty high (as where Im from you were placed in traditional public schools based on how you performed on a national exam taken in Grade 6 -  I was placed in T3 HS nationally ). A lot really happened for me in covid time and since recently transitioning schools for 6th form (losing loved ones etc.) as well and I have really been trying to get my grades back up especially for upcoming IB exams.

**Letters of Recommendation**

I think I had/have a good relationship with my teachers so I could see them writing good recommendations ! My history & English teacher. 

**Interviews**
N/A

**Essays**

I spent a while brain storming but everything besides UNC was written in a couple days -UNC was written in like 2 weeks+my personal statement. Lots of tweaking and reusing tbh but I think I wrote them decently. I think my UNC supplementals were strong and I managed to make myself seem more specialized/spiked than my very chaotic transcript & ECs show. A lot of my supps were based on my UNC supps so yeah. 

My personal statement was about my longterm involvement in my mom’s business, how it’s affected our relationship and how I’ve turned it into a way for me & my mom to mend our relationship as well as help others.

**Additional Information:**

I switched schools halfway through highschool. Going from a noncompetitive school to a super competitive one & it really messed me up but also messed with my ECs so that’s why there’s weird starts+ends+ a lot joined in senior year.

I’m just really happy about this, my mom didn’t get to finish college because life got in the way and I’m not even sure if my dad finished high school so being able to go to college is amazing, never mind going to a top school. 

I was freaking out thinking that I wouldn’t get in because I live in a competitive place (my sat is like 50pts above the average at my school) & a decent amount of ppl with good stats still don’t manage to get in. But my work clearly showed !! We’ll see what RD holds for me !!

**Essays**

I started writing my essays during august. I was apart of a program that gave me a mentor I'd meet up with weekly. They helped me brainstorm ideas, and revised my essays. I put my heart and soul into these essays, and really didn't feel the need to hide my true identity (Nonbinary ADHD person). It's really hard for me to understand how others can write their supplements a day or two before the deadline of a uni. It took me weeks to feel confident in my essays... I guess i'm not gifted like that tho.

tbh, i'm still in shock about how I got into USC. I applied to all of these schools because my mentor told me I could do it, but in the back of my head I didn't think it was possible. I feel kinda guilty, but I went through some ""what is ur USC decision"" posts, and looked at the chanceme's of people who got deferred. Some of these people at 1570+ SAT's, perfect EC's, apparently really great essays, and LOR's. Yet, they got deferred (and rejected from other ED schools.) If affirmative action was legal i'd blame it on that, but it isn't, so i'm really just lost.

ANYHOW, enough being negative. USC wants me, so i'll just trust their choice XD.

**Letters of Recommendation**

I was told ""I was in good hands"" by my counselor, but I feel like he might be sugarcoating it or just letting me down easily. 

  
When I only needed two, we did Econ Teacher and Finance/Marketing Teacher. I'm not very sure about the arrangements, but my counselor made the calls and I do trust him.



Counselor: We're cool I believe. They know a lot about my plans and worked with me a bunch. I did get on their nerves a couple of notable times but I hope that's just some isolated incidents. We talk, I tell him bad jokes, yeah. 

Micro/Macro/Micro TA Teacher: I think I did well in his classes compared to my peers, I asked him questions when I needed and we conversed. They also told me and another student we were his first TA choices so... I hope we're chill. 

Finance/Marketing Teacher: I'm honestly a bit surprised they agreed to write it and that we used it. I only had them for one year, and I did good in finance and less so in marketing. I was mostly respectful, they don't converse with students that much. I do like them, but I'm just not sure about our relationship.

Precalculus Teacher: I struggled a bit in their class, but I did recover throughout the semesters. I tried a lot in his class, asked him a lot of questions, and joked around a lot with him. I feel like we are on good terms. Only had him for one year though. 

Brit Lit/ Lit / Lang Teacher: I felt terrible asking her for a rec letter. I had her for a while, and she's in charge of the Student Council, and she's really nice. I just did really poorly in lit and never really recovered from that. 

**Interviews**

Penn: Was a poor experience overall. I was initially given the wrong time, and when we actually did have the meeting, I answered questions with a lot of repetition and not the best content. They didn't ask me many questions and it was just me. I was just glad it was over. 



**Essays**

IK I wasn't strong stats-wise and inadequate EC-wise, so I tried really hard to write essays that are different. I tried throwing some curveballs, but I guess they didn't strike. There wasn't too much revising and the timing is tight (most RDs were started post-Chicago Deferral), though the counselor did greenlight it with some time to spare. 

CA: Discussed crashing a bike after moving countries, realizing it was due to different braking standards, enhancing my cultural curiosity. 

Why Major: Talked about shifting perspectives on business and desire to enter compliance. 

Community: Student council, helping develop connections within the team and general student body. 

Extracurricular: Badminton, inspired my physical and mental growth, dand eveloped high personal standards in me. 



**Decisions** 

*Acceptances:*

* University of Sydney (Australia)
* Griffith University (Australia)
* CWRU (EA)

*Deferral:*

* UT Austin (EA) - Didn't feel that bad, it was just a really confusing series of events.
* USC (EA) - This one hurt, I went there for a program and got attached. People I like got in and it stung to not be able to join them/be as good as them. 
* UChicago (EA) - Now ED2. It was a bit upsetting since I had a good time working on the supps + video.

*Rejections:*

* Penn (ED) - I wanted USC bad, so I just opted to burn the ED slot on the absolute best. 

TBD 

* Vanderbilt (RD)
* Northeastern (EA)
* CMU (RD)
* Stanford (RD)
* UNC (RD)
* UCs (Berkeley, LA, SD, Irvine, I kinda forgot the other names) (RD)
* UW Seattle (RD)
* Brown (RD)
* BU (RD)
* Colgate (RD)
* Rutgers New Brunswick (RD)
* Tufts (RD)
* NYU (RD)
* WashU (RD)
* Emory (RD)
* UMich (RD)

**What Went Wrong?** 

Just rallied a bit too late in every aspect honestly. I didn't care much for grades in G9 and only started realizing I was able to perform well academically as G10 ended. Rigor was also stagnant for too long. ECs were subpar; I didn't take initiative when I needed, and ultimately didn't achieve much. The consistent upward trends in extracurriculars and academics weren't enough in the end. I did not deserve to get into the schools I tried for. 

  
Regardless, I feel like I did the best I could to put up a good application. I followed my school and private counselors' instructions and did everything based on the instructions. I don't feel like I was particularly stubborn with anything but the college list, and I did as asked even when I disagreed or thought something didn't look right. 



The list was tragic. I got accepted into USyd early (before the US cycle started), and having to ask the question ""Would I pick this US uni over the best Aussie school"" made it so I only had reaches. To make since worse, I did B-Schools because going Econ when there's Business just felt wrong. I don't believe in any more acceptances coming.  

  
But the core reason for the list is just insecurity. I felt like it was too much effort to go low, but not enough to go high ... just painfully in the middle of good or bad. Ultimately, I just didn't want to feel worse than my competitive-ass classmates, so I punched up and hoped that the admissions process was genuinely random. 

It didn't work out well, but Australia or Case is still a decent floor. I'm just bitter over USC

**Notes:**

Okay, I have a LOT OF THOUGHTS regarding the college application process so I am going to (unnecessarily chaotically) write them down here.

First off, I am not suddenly the messiah of college admissions just because I got into CMU. Please take everything I say here with healthy skepticism! These are just a 17 year old's opinions!

If you are doom scrolling this subreddit trying to ascertain your chances of getting into certain colleges, LOG OFF RIGHT NOW AND JUST WRITE THE APPLICATION. Several months ago, I was doing the same and almost removed CMU from my list. First of all, you cannot accurately ascertain what correlates to acceptances into which colleges because there are SO MANY CONFOUNDING VARIABLES and also a great deal of sheer randomness. Secondly, after you have your common app stuff done, most applications takes like max 10 hours. If you have the time, just apply everywhere you want to, and if they reject you, that's like max 10 hours wasted :D.

I don't want to push my opinions on to you, but I think ""applying sideways"" is a really good idea, not necessarily because it will improve your results, but because it will allow to grow into an actual adult who knows what they want before college, which I think is pretty useful.

College counselors are, in my opinion, generally pretty useless. I didn't make use of counseling services, but my brother and friends did and the all the advice their counselors gave seemed pretty bullshitty to me (for example, ""show more family values"" or ""you should showcase your entrepreneurial side in this essay""). They can say whatever they want and chances are you'll believe them, and they will generally be able to show that they give students better-than-median college results because, in general, only the wealthy can afford them, and the wealthy have myriad other advantages in college applications.

Which college you go to doesn't determine your worth as a person (obviously)! I am still a hot mess (at least I'm hot though)!!!!!!

I had little confidence going into this process, and it really doesn't matter whether I was right or wrong to have low confidence because it was still unproductive. Have some healthy conceit, kings, queens, and everything in betweens!

Controversial, but can we please collectively kill the jarring present tense ""hook"" that doesn't match the tone of the rest of the essay? Please and thank you /hj.

I don't know you, but if it means anything, I believe in you :D. Not for college admissions specifically, just in general, I believe in you!

Feel free to reach out to me! Also, if you know me, please don't dox :3",https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1i3r76m/bay_area_baddie_bags_cmu_cs/,1737149184,1550,,4,South Asian,"CMU SCS (ED) - Committed!, UC Merced (RD), Chico State (RD), I retracted everything else lol",,"Notes:**, Okay, I have a LOT OF THOUGHTS regarding the college application process so I am going to (unnecessarily chaotically) write them down here., First off, I am not suddenly the messiah of college admissions just because I got into CMU.

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

1. International Night Region Head (11th-12th) - being a region head means that whatever region you choose/get, you are in charge of EVERYTHING involved with this region for International Night. so i had to pick out the decorations (posters, structures, etc), decide what food/drinks would be best to serve (and how much of each item needs to be made/brought), assist and get people to assist with creating all of the decorations i decided on, then set-up everything the morning of IN. (i know i used ""i"" a lot in here, but this is not a one-person job. Every region has 2-3 heads, it was a team effort!)
2. International Night Performer (11th-12th) - so on top of everything i had to do as a region head, i also decided i wanted to perform! i created a dance group with my friends (who were all caribbean of course) and we created a choreography to a mix of different (and iconic) caribbean songs. made it through auditions both years, can't wait to perform again this year
3. National Art Honors Society (12th, would have been 11-12 but i was too lazy to join last year lol) - mainly just volunteer stuff. Helped create prompts for our school's Inktober, made trophies for an award ceremony, assisted in painting a mural, etc etc
4. National Chinese Honors Society (12th) - also volunteer stuff, i create ads for events we host that get posted onto our social media/morning announcements
5. Dance Group outside of IN (11th-12th) - we were invitied by a haitian organization to perform at one of their events, as well as given the opportunity to perform at a roody roodboy (haitian artist) concert. We accepted the haitian event (and it was a success! i did a TON of the choreography for that) but declined the concert because it would've had us in Atlanta at night.
6. Intern at a merchandise printing company (12th) - gatekeeping the name of the company, but just imagine a store that will print any design on any type of material for your own business/needs! I assist in order production/packaging, after-school lessons to kids interested in learning about printing, and research on how they can expand their business further for networking and whatnot. really love this experience :D
7. Art club (9th-11th) - i really only attended art club, but i'm technically an assistant teacher right now... i just haven't gone to any of the meetings this year........... oopsies

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

1. Art teacher (9/10)- she's had me for all 4 years, so she's seen how my art has developed first hand. she can very easily give any insight on my talents and creative processes, as well as me as a whole. i don't act a fool in her class so i think she gave me a solid rec letter!
2. 11th grade ela teacher (9/10)- all of the writing i did in her classes had SOOOO much of me in it. there was not a single essay that i didn't put my personality into. i also wrote about a lot of deep stuff in her class so i'm hoping she put some of that in there to show how i don't let the bad bring me down too much. i talked to her as a person and less as a teacher, so she saw my personality through and through. genuinely wish i could read her letter but i waived FERPA rights </3
3. Counselor (5/10)- LOLLLLL i have not spoken to her in person a single time. the first time i've spoken to her was THIS YEAR THROUGH EMAILLLL. I MIGHT BE COOKED WITH HER LETTER

**Essays**

\- i chose the common app prompt about an event that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of myself. i'm not gonna go into too much detail about it because it's deep (to an extent), but it was just all about how i have a tendency to dramatize my mistakes and didn't realize that until last year!

\- for uga I wrote about 13 reasons why for the book that changed me, you can guess what i said!

\- for gsu i talked about my admiration for visual-kei artists, due to the fact that they're actively going against all social/gender norms in Japan!

Personal Statement: 7/10

So where do I even begin... 😭😭😭 This (along with my ECs) made me lose confidence in my apps. It felt like a lot was missing, even though it went through multiple different revisions. I think this was the best version (and personal statement) I wrote, but it could've been a lot better.

Wrote about my first experiences of using film photography, the nature of film (you can't just delete images since a roll of film is physical), how it correlates to core memories, and connected it to one of my core memories. The experiences not only sparked my interest in photography as a whole but made me acknowledge to keep onto those special feelings and moments, and perhaps create even more.

AP CSP teacher & Girls Who Code advisor (formerly) & coding club advisor (currently) - 6/10 (could be glowing because I've known her all of high school, but she asked me to fill out a recommendation request form in the third person)

AP Afro Teacher - 8/10 (I got a B in the class but contributed a lot to the in-class academic discourse because the course content was extremely engaging; he's the kind of teacher to flat out say no if he wasn't going to write a glowing recommendation for a student anyway)

Counselor - 7/10 (I've talked with her pretty frequently since freshman year since Northeastern was my goal, and since I worked closely with the counselors on that #1 EC I wouldn't be surprised if she referenced it)

**Interviews**

N/A

**Essays**

Took 2 months to write something coherent but avoided the ADHD essay and then went with the other cliche ""I love learning!"" essay, centered around math and logical problem solving through niche hobbies (like WIkipedia games). I was worried that it would look like a discrepancy to have B's in said math classes, but I think that my SAT and AP score(s) made up for that? In retrospect, my essay was kinda trash- in fact, I submitted the wrong essay like... everywhere except for the one RD school I submitted. By the time I realized, I just coped and fixed it for the last couple EAs.

Personal statement: I wrote about how a true crime assigned summer reading book kickstarted my realization/journey into recovery from a diagnosed borderline and frequent psych hospital patient, help me develop a broader sense of empathy I lacked, and got me passionate about prison reform and made me realize why I wanted to become a prison psychologist. Hefty I know lmao. I got VERY positive feedback on this essay.

**Decisions**
- University of Pittsburgh: Accepted into Johnstown Campus
- Temple University: Accepted

**Additional Information:**

I had severe mental health issues and was hospitalized a lot my junior year, so bad I missed my finals which severely brought my gpa down. I was a star student sophomore year and at the start of senior year (this year) I had a 4.0 for the year but cumulatively I fucked up. I know already my decisions aren’t amazing and that my other decisions back are gonna be hefty rejections from the selective places but I can’t change anything and I made my application the best I could. I see a lot of AMAZING people on here but wanted to share mine anyway so far in case anyone is similar to me. 100% could’ve done better it is what it is and I can’t change the past.

**Essays**

EA commonapp- 8/10, people had mixed opinions because “everyoneeee hates topic 6” 🙄 but the people’s feedback who is ACTUALLY reliable (language arts teachers) was really positive, it was a cute story abt how i went from fearing radiation bc of a crazy childhood experience to being fascinated and reverent of it by trusting in science

Lang teacher: I wasnt very close with him, but hes an awesome human being, and always appreciated me taking my time to come to his tutorials review our essays and mcqs. Hes literally one of the best writers and teachers ive ever met. probably around 7-8/10 (just because i wasnt toooo close with him)

Rice: I was interviewed online by a senior who was very nice. I answered the questions without thinking about ""correct answers"". Just literally what i think with no filters. We had a great time, laughed a bit. I want to think it positively impacted my application.

**Essays**

Writing was never one of my strongest skills, but I noticed it improved significantly after this process. I started researching into essays starting June, read dozens of essays and analyzed what I liked about essays I liked. 

Personal statement: A narrative about one of my volunteering activities, focusing on my emotions during it. Its not the most beautiful writing in the world, but it is definitely the most ""me"" writing in the world. I read over it now, and I still think and essay cannot show the person I am better than this. 

I wrote a supplemental about my speedcubing journey that I liked so much I twisted it to fit into as many supplementals as I could. Also probably one of the best things ive written.
